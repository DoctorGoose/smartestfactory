# Priority Splitter

## Trivia  
  
Some players report a Mandela Effect regarding the "Priority Splitter," believing it was introduced alongside the **[Priority Merger](/wiki/Priority_Merger "Priority Merger")** in [Update 1.1](/wiki/Update_1.1 "Update 1.1"), and that it functioned similarly with three levels of priority for output ports. However, while the **[Priority Merger](/wiki/Priority_Merger "Priority Merger")** _was_ added in that update, no such "Priority Splitter" has ever existed in the game.
