## World

[](/wiki/File:Hog_Jetpack_easter_egg.jpg)

[](/wiki/File:Hog_Jetpack_easter_egg.jpg "Enlarge")

A Hog wearing a Jetpack.

  * In Coffee Stain's Satisfactory level design stream, at one point a model of a "[pipe](/wiki/Pipe "Pipe")" is shown to exist below a part of the map, in reference to a pervasive community meme.[1] It is unclear if this easter egg was included in the game's current or past release builds, however.
  * A single [Walker](/wiki/Walker "Walker") could be encountered in the world in old patches. This is a reference to another game made by [Coffee Stain](/wiki/Coffee_Stain_Studios "Coffee Stain Studios"), [Sanctum 2](https://www.coffeestainstudios.com/games/sanctum-2/).
  * [Fluffy-tailed Hogs](/wiki/Fluffy-tailed_Hog "Fluffy-tailed Hog") can be found wearing [Jetpacks](/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack"). The Hog can use the Jetpack when charging on a pioneer. Upon contact, the Hog explodes, killing both itself and its target. 
    * They seem to persist between saves, at least if they are loaded when saving.
    * If one despawns, its Jetpack might not despawn with it and remain hovering in place.
    * The Hog is referred to in the code as "Johnny"[2]



## Interface

[](/wiki/File:HUB_Milestone_Fist_easter_egg.gif)

[](/wiki/File:HUB_Milestone_Fist_easter_egg.gif "Enlarge")

The fist easter egg

  * During the tutorial, the panel on the left is labelled as the "Pioneer Obligatory Onboarding Program", the acronym of which is "POOP".
  * Occasionally, when pressing the pod launch button at the [HUB](/wiki/HUB "HUB") terminal, a large cartoon fist will appear and slam down on the button, with an accompanying "boom" sound.
  * Rapidly clicking on the power graph of any generator [building](/wiki/Buildings "Buildings") or [Power Pole](/wiki/Power_Pole "Power Pole") will lock the [pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer") out of it for abuse of [FICSIT](/wiki/FICSIT_Inc. "FICSIT Inc.") property, suggesting multiple treatment options including "exposure to dangerous substances".
  * Sometimes, when pressing the button to scan a Hard Drive while none is inserted in the [MAM](/wiki/MAM "MAM"), it will "become sentient"[3] for a short time before being restarted. See also [MAM Trivia](/wiki/MAM#Trivia "MAM").
  * The name of a [Portable Miner](/wiki/Portable_Miner "Portable Miner") will occasionally change to “Portobello Miner” on the miner interface once filled with ore.
  * The name of a [Factory Cart](/wiki/Factory_Cart "Factory Cart") will occasionally change to "Puny Vroom".
  * There is a small chance that, when opening the [Resource Scanner](/wiki/Resource_Scanner "Resource Scanner")'s wheel menu, the icon label for "Coal" will be shown properly capitalized, while all the other choices have random capitalization. This is a reference to [patches 0.3.6](/wiki/Patch_0.3.6 "Patch 0.3.6") to [0.3.6.3](/wiki/Patch_0.3.6.3 "Patch 0.3.6.3"), where "coal" was improperly capitalized as "cOAL", then after the community pointed it out it was jokingly patched to the Easter egg's capitalization.
  * On the [Portal](/wiki/Portal "Portal") UI there is a reference to [The Fly (1986) film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fly_\(1986_film\)).


  * [](/wiki/File:Random_Capitalization_Glitch.png "Resource Scanner random capitalization Easter Egg.")

  * [](/wiki/File:Portal_Easter_Egg_-_Fly.png "Portal UI Easter Egg showing Fly.")

Portal UI Easter Egg showing Fly.




## Emotes and Animations

### Naruto

  * Occasionally, when doing the clap emote, the pioneer might do a sequence of Naruto hand gestures where red bugs shoot out of your hand.[4]
  * Sometimes the default sprinting animation gets replaced by a Naruto running animation.[5] This is only visible to other players in [multiplayer](/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer").



### [Lights](/wiki/Lights "Lights")

  * By doing the [clap emote](/wiki/Pioneer#Emote "Pioneer"), nearby lights toggle on and off.[6] This is most likely in reference to the [original "Clapper"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clapper), a sound-activated electrical switch, sold since 1984.



## Equipment

  * When picking up the [Build Gun](/wiki/Build_Gun "Build Gun")/[Resource Scanner](/wiki/Resource_Scanner "Resource Scanner") after the drop pod sequence, the pioneer smooths down a sticker of BoxBoy from Coffee Stain Studios' first game [I <3 Strawberries](https://www.coffeestainstudios.com/games/i-3-strawberries/).
  * The Build Gun has numerous lines of text printed on its casing.
  * When striking with the [Xeno-Zapper](/wiki/Xeno-Zapper "Xeno-Zapper"), the player will occasionally punch instead.
  * Rarely when reloading the [Rebar Gun](/wiki/Rebar_Gun "Rebar Gun"), the pioneer will sometimes drop it (it will rapidly fly back afterwards).[7]
  * Rarely when reloading the [Rifle](/wiki/Rifle "Rifle"), the pioneer will throw it at target (it will return).[8]
  * The animation that plays when first equipping the [Chainsaw](/wiki/Chainsaw "Chainsaw") is similar to the equivalent animation from the 2016 Doom game.
  * The flashlight light pattern [resembles](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/qyf3u2/has_anyone_noticed_the_torch_is_the_coffee_stain/) Coffee Stain Studios logo.


  * [](/wiki/File:Construction_Tool_Hidden_Text.png "SN: 0987654321 RU1F-M40 \(dog-cat sounds in English\)")

## Storage

### [Personal Storage Box](/wiki/Personal_Storage_Box "Personal Storage Box")

  * Hidden underneath the **Hazard Storage Box** is what looks like a squashed bug or creature.
  * Some have speculated that what looks like a squashed bug or creature might in fact have been a damage repair and that what is seen is the solder used by the Pioneer to fix a crack on the bottom.
  * This Easter Egg does not appear on the bottom of the **Personal Storage Box** or the **Medical Storage Box**.
  * This Easter Egg was added in Update 5 when the both the Medical Storage Box and Hazard Storage Box were added to the Game.

## Vehicles

### [Factory Cart](/wiki/Factory_Cart "Factory Cart")

  * Upon finishing the deployment animation, the Factory Cart has a rare chance to play an audio clip. 
    * "Robots in disguise".[9]



### [FICSIT Freighter](/wiki/FICSIT_Freighter "FICSIT Freighter")

  * The model number of the freighter (5KY-3) is a reference to Skye from the Sanctum franchise.[10]
  * On the side of both the [parked](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB") and [crashed](/wiki/Crash_Site "Crash Site") freighters reads the serial number UN-R34-L 3NG1N3, a reference to Unreal Engine (the game engine that [Satisfactory](/wiki/Satisfactory "Satisfactory") is built upon.)


  * [](/wiki/File:Serial-number-on-crashed-freighter.webp)

  * [](/wiki/File:Serial-number-on-parked-freighter.webp)




### Trains

  * Hidden on the left side of the [Electric Locomotive](/wiki/Electric_Locomotive "Electric Locomotive") is a sticker for the Swedish nu-metal group [LOK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOK_\(band\) "wikipedia:LOK \(band\)"). Their name is an abbreviation for the Swedish word _lokomotiv_.
  * The face that is hidden under the train is a picture of a Swedish television host called [Leif "Loket" Olsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leif_%22Loket%22_Olsson "wikipedia:Leif "Loket" Olsson"), where the nickname Loket is the Swedish word for [Locomotive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive "wikipedia:Locomotive").


  * [](/wiki/File:Train_easter_egg.png)

  * [](/wiki/File:Electric_Locomotive_LOK_Sticker.png)




### Cyber Wagon

  * The [Cyber Wagon](/wiki/Cyber_Wagon "Cyber Wagon") is an obvious reference to the Tesla Cybertruck.
  * It can be unlocked by feeding a single [FICSIT Coupon](/wiki/FICSIT_Coupon "FICSIT Coupon") into the [AWESOME Sink](/wiki/AWESOME_Sink "AWESOME Sink").



## Buildings

  * Many of the buildings feature sequences of letters and numbers that spell out words related to their functions in "l33t speak".[11]
  * The Korolev logo can appear on the side of a Crash Site.


  * [](/wiki/File:Korolev-crash-site.webp "Korolev logo appearing on a Crash Site in Patch 0.8.0.5.")

### [The HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB")

  * The HUB contains several minor Easter eggs once it is fully completed. 
    * The terminal near where the [MAM](/wiki/MAM "MAM") used to have computer screens with references to Windows BSOD and closed alpha testers.
    * Under the tall monitor there is a dark screen with the phrase "See you space cowboy_". That's a reference to the anime "Cowboy Bebop". Most of the episodes ends with [this screen](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=See%20You%20Space%20Cowboy...).
    * There is a picture of Pilgor the goat inside of the HUB’s computer room, being a clear reference to Coffee Stain's Goat Simulator series.
    * There is an alpaca plush toy in the lower bunk bed. 
      * This is most likely a reference to [Tech Artist Ben de Hullu](/wiki/Coffee_Stain_Studios#Coffee_Stain_Studios "Coffee Stain Studios") who is known for his love of them.
    * There is a [Mr. Meeseeks box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Meeseeks "wikipedia:Mr. Meeseeks") from the animated TV show "Rick and Morty" at the foot of the top bunk. 
      * This was likely added because Dan Harmon, the creator of the show, [is a fan of Satisfactory](https://www.instagram.com/p/C_ermK9ppPA/).
    * There is a book with the title of "The Mathematics of Wonton Burrito Meals" which is in reference to an episode on the Futurama show.[12]
    * There is a FICSIT Rubik's Cube-like object on the shelf adjacent to the character customization locker. 
      * It has been noted that the colour scheme on this Rubik's Cube is not true to the original.
    * There is a nicotine punch box (snus box) beneath the FICSIT book about Mycelia as a reference to that the Swedish invented and commonly use snus boxes.
    * The toilet cubicle has a promotional poster stuck on the wall that depicts a company named Korolev, referencing _[The Cycle](https://thecycle.game/)_. 
      * In turn, FICSIT posters appear in _The Cycle_.

### [Miner Mk.1](/wiki/Miner_Mk.1 "Miner Mk.1")

  * The serial number of the drill pipe segments reads "P1P3 1000", which may have been part of [the long-running joke on Coffee Stain's part that they weren't going to add pipes](/wiki/Pipeline#Trivia "Pipeline") to [Satisfactory](/wiki/Satisfactory "Satisfactory").


  * [](/wiki/File:Miner-mk1-pipe-easter-egg.webp)




### [Equipment Workshop](/wiki/Equipment_Workshop "Equipment Workshop")

  * A can in the workshop's shelves strongly resembles a can of Milo[13], a drink powder primarily sold in Australia and New Zealand, but is also available in [other various countries worldwide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo_\(drink\)#Marketing). 
    * Milo has previously appeared in Coffee Stain videos.
    * Jace confirmed that, despite him being the resident Australian in [Coffee Stain](/wiki/Coffee_Stain "Coffee Stain"), he had nothing to do with this Easter egg being added to the game, claiming he has "only inspired one of the artists with his Milo tutorial".[14]


  * The workshop's shelves contains a few items commonly found in a workshop. 
    * 2 cans of "Lack-nafta", meaning white spirit in Swedish, can be found on the workshop table itself.
    * 1 bottle of "Trälim", meaning wood glue in Swedish, can be found on the workshop table.
    * Another can of "Lack-nafta" can be found on the shelve under the tools on the right side of the workshop, along with another bottle of "Trälim".


  * On the floor, there is a drill bit from the Portable [Miner](/wiki/Miner "Miner").



### [Space Elevator](/wiki/Space_Elevator "Space Elevator")

[](/wiki/File:FicsitLogoLights.png)

### [Resource Well Pressurizer](/wiki/Resource_Well_Pressurizer "Resource Well Pressurizer")

  * The Resource Well Pressurizer UI will sometimes include the phrase "Respawning Lizard Doggos..." or "Feeding the Developers..." or "Working sorta..." or "Keeping the cogs turning..." or "Doing my best...", or "Producing..." instead of normal UI.[15]
  * There is a chance when opening the Resource Well Extractor UI for it to say "fracking, kind of..." or "trying really hard..." instead of "extracting..."


  * [](/wiki/File:Easter_Egg_-_Resource_Pressurizer.png "Resource Well Pressurizer UI showing "Respawning Lizard Doggos..."")

## [Boom Box](/wiki/Boom_Box "Boom Box")

  * On the top bar of the [Boom Box](/wiki/Boom_Box "Boom Box") it is possible to see the words "FICSIT 'ASS' - Automated Sound System" [16]



## Sound

  * The sound produced by [pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer") running on [Foundations](/wiki/Foundation "Foundation") syncs with the factory background music.
  * When mining [resources](/wiki/Resource_Node "Resource Node") by hand, the sound of the chisel syncs with We Will Rock You by Queen.[17] This was later revealed to be an unintentional coincidence.[18]
  * The horn of the [Electric Locomotive](/wiki/Electric_Locomotive "Electric Locomotive") is sometimes replaced with a steam locomotive whistle.[19]
  * During the [FICS⁕MAS event](/wiki/FICSMAS "FICSMAS"), when picking up a present, [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA") has a chance to say "Merry Christmas you filthy animals."
  * When hitting the ground, the sound of a cartoon spring will sometimes play.



## Chat

  * Using in game chat [`↵ Enter`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), typing "Thanks Jace, helps a lot" plays an audio clip from the Update 5 release video, where **Juice Velvet** _([Jace Varlet](/wiki/Coffee_Stain_Studios#Former_employees "Coffee Stain Studios") \- former Coffee Stain Studios Community Manager)_ enumerates the new [Customizer](/wiki/Customizer "Customizer") features. The audio clip ends with a brief comment by **Snutty Mays** ([Snutt Treptow](/wiki/Coffee_Stain_Studios#Snutt "Coffee Stain Studios")) Coffee Stain Studios Community Manager, followed by [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA") saying "Thanks Jace".[20][21][22]



## [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA") messages

### General

  * In one message there is a clear reference to the 2014 video game titled [The Talos Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Talos_Principle).


  * [](/wiki/File:Easter_Egg_-_Talos_Principle_Reference.png "ADA Message that is a clear reference to the 2014 video game titled "The Talos Principle"\[23\]")

### MAM research

These ADA voice lines will randomly play when you research multiple MAM technologies before she finished speaking _(CREDIT: Reddit Member u/StoneRings_ [24]_)_ : 

  * Very efficient. Also rude.
  * Your enthusiasm for Saving The Day has been noted. Your attitude has also been noted.
  * If you are confident you already understand the new technologies you are about to use, by all means, learn the hard way.
  * The message you just skipped is one of the winners of the monthly Pioneers' Choice 'Most Interesting Message' award. What a shame.
  * I see that I'm talking too slow for your taste.  
 _(Extremely Sped Up Inaudible Speech)_  
I hope that was enlightening. 
    * This might be a reference to the video game titled "Portal 2". [25]
  * Sometimes toes need to be stepped on for the sake of progress. Fortunately for you, I have no toes.
  * I will now assume you are an expert, and judge your use of these technologies accordingly.
  * Rushed research and development is exactly why the Save the Day program exists.
  * Not listening to instructions means you waive FICSIT's responsibility for any accidents or misuse of these technologies.
  * I wonder: is it that you're eager to please, impatient, or very efficient? I have my theory.



### Emotes

These ADA voice lines will randomly play when doing certain emotes: 

  * Twirl: "Quickest draw in the galactic quadrant" [26]
  * Twirl: "Yeehaw" [27]
  * Twirl: "Howdy Partner"
