A cave environment with [Glowing Round Blue Cap Mushrooms](/wiki/Round_Blue_Cap_Mushroom "Round Blue Cap Mushroom").

A **cave** is any area in the Satisfactory [world](/wiki/World "World") that is located underground. Numerous caves are spread across the map, with varying widely in size and scope. Some caves may act as shortcuts between areas, stretching under mountains, whereas others may only have a single entrance and hide a secret or reward, sometimes even acting as an obstacle gauntlet for the player to surmount. 

Cave entrances often blend in with the landscape and can be hard to spot. Sometimes, cave entrances can be obscured by waterfalls, hanging vines that must be removed by the player, or breakable rocks that must be blasted away with [explosives](/wiki/Nobelisk "Nobelisk").

## Environment

Cave interiors usually consist mainly of bare rock with scattered pebbles. Depending on the biome, plant roots may protrude through the ceiling. Almost all caves are filled with stalactites and stalagmites, mainly as a decorative element. [Mycelial](/wiki/Mycelia "Mycelia") growths (mushrooms) are also common, making caves a good location to scavenge their resources. Some caves feature a blue, bio-luminescent grass-like plant covering on their ground surface, and some larger caves include large, glowing blue mushrooms, which serve as a player light source. 

Some caves function as secret item locations, often blocked by a gauntlet of obstacles for the player. These commonly include (detonatable) large [boulders](/wiki/Boulder "Boulder"), [Stingers](/wiki/Stinger "Stinger"), or [Poison Gas](/wiki/Poison_Gas "Poison Gas"), but the player will frequently be rewarded with a [Power Slug](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug") or an alien artifact ([Somersloop](/wiki/Somersloop "Somersloop")/[Mercer Sphere](/wiki/Mercer_Sphere "Mercer Sphere")) for overcoming these. 

### Rain

Some larger caves are known to have droplets of water seen falling from the overhead stalactites (ceiling),[1][2] which is often referred to as "rain". While actual surface rain was removed in Update 8,[3] due to the upgrade to [Unreal Engine 5](/wiki/Unreal_Engine "Unreal Engine"), some larger caves still had the subsurface "rain".[4]

## List of caves

There are 52 caves mapped in the Online Interactive Map.[5] Many more caves are in the game but yet to be mapped. 

Minor caves/ravines  Name  | Contents  | No. of entrances

Somersloop Tunnel  | A short tunnel in the Grass Fields beside 3 normal iron nodes. Great for collecting [Mycelia](/wiki/Mycelia "Mycelia").  | 2   
Mercer Sphere Cave  | A short tunnel near the central void containing just a [Mercer Sphere](/wiki/Mercer_Sphere "Mercer Sphere"). Covered by vines that need to be [chainsawed](/wiki/Chainsaw "Chainsaw").  | 1   
Fungus Under-cliff  | Covered by layers of fungus above, the shade below it contains blue power slugs along with 2 oil nodes.  | 2   
Waterfall Cave  | Beside the cluster of coal nodes is a waterfall, which is the entrance to a cave containing a yellow power slug.  | 1   
Major caves  Name  | Contents  | No. of entrances   
---|---|---

### Stacked Caves

Different caves can stack on each other on different elevations. 

  * [Uranium](/wiki/Uranium "Uranium") Cave and the Purple Power Slug cave at the [Grass Fields](/wiki/Grass_Fields "Grass Fields")
  * Two Stinger caves at the [Blue Crater](/wiki/Blue_Crater "Blue Crater")
  * Lizard Doggo cave and the Purple Power Slug cave near East to the [Islands](/wiki/Islands "Islands")
  * A Blue Power Slug cave above the cavern located below the spire of [Rocky Desert](/wiki/Rocky_Desert "Rocky Desert")
  * Several caves located within the mesa of the [Spire Coast](/wiki/Spire_Coast "Spire Coast"), with hard to spot entrances.
