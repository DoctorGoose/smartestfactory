About Satisfactory

[Satisfactory](/wiki/Satisfactory "Satisfactory") is a game from [Coffee Stain Studios](/wiki/Coffee_Stain_Studios "Coffee Stain Studios"), the creators of [Goat Simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat_Simulator "wikipedia:Goat Simulator") and the [Sanctum](https://sanctum.gamepedia.com) series. Satisfactory is a game of factory management and planet exploitation. As a pioneer working for [FICSIT Inc.](/wiki/FICSIT_Inc. "FICSIT Inc."), you are dropped onto an alien planet with a handful of tools and must harvest the planet's natural resources to construct increasingly complex factories for automating all your resources needs. After you are set up, it will be time to build the [Space Elevator](/wiki/Space_Elevator "Space Elevator") and begin Project Assembly, supplying FICSIT with increasingly numerous and complex components for their unknown purposes. 

The main focus of the game lies in constructing [buildings](/wiki/Buildings "Buildings") and linking them together with [Conveyor Belts](/wiki/Conveyor_Belts "Conveyor Belts") so that your factory can handle the entire process of item construction for you, including mining, transport, delivery, and generating [power](/wiki/Power "Power") to keep itself running. More advanced pioneers will precisely adjust their buildings' [clock speed](/wiki/Clock_speed "Clock speed") to maximize efficiency. 

Features

  * A variety of item and fluid logistics including [Conveyor Belts](/wiki/Conveyor_Belts "Conveyor Belts"), [Lifts](/wiki/Conveyor_Lift "Conveyor Lift"), [Pipes](/wiki/Pipeline "Pipeline") and more; all for transporting resources, components, fluids or yourself around.
  * [Buildings](/wiki/Buildings "Buildings") for automated production of items. Hunt down [Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug") and [Somersloops](/wiki/Somersloop "Somersloop") to improve their [performance](/wiki/Clock_speed "Clock speed").
  * A vast alien [world](/wiki/World "World") to explore and exploit, featuring beautiful vistas and curious [creatures](/wiki/Creatures "Creatures"), including the community favorite [Lizard Doggo](/wiki/Lizard_Doggo "Lizard Doggo").
  * [Vehicles](/wiki/Vehicles "Vehicles"), including [trucks](/wiki/Truck "Truck") and [trains](/wiki/Electric_Locomotive "Electric Locomotive") for transporting yourself and large quantities of resources over great distances.
  * A [story](/wiki/Story "Story") to uncover - what is the 'Save the Day' program, and why is FICSIT counting on you?
  * [Arachnophobia Mode](/wiki/Arachnophobia_Mode "Arachnophobia Mode"), to turn [scary spiders](/wiki/Stinger "Stinger") into equally terrifying cat abominations.
  * No base defense.
