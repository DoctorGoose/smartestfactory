The anniversary party in [the HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB").

Prior to 1.0, the anniversary could be considered to be March 19, the [release of _Satisfactory Early Access_](/wiki/Patch_0.1 "Patch 0.1"), in 2019. However, no anniversary celebration events were held anytime during the entirety of Early Access. 

The event festoons the [HUB](/wiki/HUB "HUB") with anniversary decorations, to include a mirror ball, flashing tile dance floor, pizza boxes with various pizzas, music, and a festive cake adorned with a candle showing the year.

## Participating

Upon loading of game save, the anniversary event in the [HUB](/wiki/HUB "HUB") will be active unless it was disabled beforehand. 

### Disabling the event

The event can be disabled using the "Disable Seasonal Events" option. This option is only available on the [title screen](/wiki/Game_menus "Game menus"), under [Options > Gameplay > Disable Seasonal Events](/wiki/Settings#Gameplay_2 "Settings"). 

In [multiplayer](/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer"), the host's configuration is used. If the host has seasonal events enabled, but the client does not, the event will be enabled in the session. 

Alternatively, seasonal events can be disabled using the `-DisableSeasonalEvents` [launch argument](/wiki/Launch_arguments "Launch arguments"). On a [dedicated server](/wiki/Dedicated_server "Dedicated server"), this launch argument is the only way to disable seasonal events.
