| ~ **ADA** |   
  
**ADA** (Artificial Directory and Assistant) is an artificial intelligence built into HudOS, which serves as a narrator in the game. It tells [pioneers](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer") what essential tasks need to be completed, how to perform certain tasks, and informs them about new [research](/wiki/Research "Research"), [milestone unlocks](/wiki/Milestones "Milestones") or important events. 

With the exception of the [planetfall sequence](/wiki/Drop-pod "Drop-pod"), artifact messages and some easter eggs, ADA is fully subtitled. Once a message is received from ADA, it can be freely viewed and replayed in the [Codex](/wiki/Codex "Codex").

I was just looking over some blueprints you are not authorized to use. Some really cool stuff.  | Oh, I'm not authorized to tell what's in it, but I was reading your evaluation data. It's so funny!  | I was reading some really interesting data. By the way, did you know there were recently a nasty bug when dismantling a car with a driver still inside? I have the photos here.

*thank you  | I'm doing my best.  | I'm happy to be appreciated.  | I'm just doing my job.  |  |  |  |  |   
*give me  | I might look in to that. Not ETA though. Might take a while.  | Sorry, I can't send you anything. I'm afraid you have to make it yourself.  | Yes! Absolutely. Coming right up. Oh, never mind. I'm not allowed to send it.  | Sorry, I can't help you with that. I'm not authorized to send you anything.  |  |  |  |

## Easter eggs

**Expand to reveal spoiler**

Occasionally, when doing certain actions, ADA voice line Easter eggs will play. 

_Main article:_[ Easter eggs > ADA messages](/wiki/Easter_eggs#ADA_messages "Easter eggs")

## Narrative

**Expand to reveal spoiler**

When performing specific actions, the player will hear ADA speak, sometimes delivering a corrupted message in a different voice shown as [???](/wiki/%3F%3F%3F "???"). 

  * View [Story](/wiki/Story "Story") to read and hear individual messages, both normal (ADA) and corrupted (???), related to various actions.



## Trivia

  * When a [](/wiki/FICSIT_Coupon "FICSIT Coupon") [FICSIT Coupon](/wiki/FICSIT_Coupon "FICSIT Coupon") is sunk into the [AWESOME Sink](/wiki/AWESOME_Sink "AWESOME Sink"), the [Cyber Wagon](/wiki/Cyber_Wagon "Cyber Wagon") is unlocked. ADA will then tell the pioneer that the Cyber Wagon is its "first solo project".
  * The speech engine used by ADA is the Female gendered "en-US-Wavenet-C" provided by Google Cloud Text-to-Speech with voice effects applied to it, confirmed by Jace and Snutt.[2][3]

## History

  * [Patch 1.1.0.4](/wiki/Patch_1.1.0.4 "Patch 1.1.0.4"): Removed ADA commentary during regular building (Set to play every ~30 mins) due to community feedback
  * [Patch 1.1.0.2](/wiki/Patch_1.1.0.2 "Patch 1.1.0.2"): Fixed ADA messages that were missing voice lines
  * [Patch 1.0](/wiki/Patch_1.0 "Patch 1.0")
    * There is now narrative and lore in the game. We implemented this in a way which won’t be intrusive for existing players (since [Satisfactory](/wiki/Satisfactory "Satisfactory") is still a factory building game at its core), but there should still be a lot of interesting lore to dive into for those who were looking for more details about [FICSIT](/wiki/FICSIT_Inc. "FICSIT Inc."), ADA, [Project Assembly](/wiki/Project_Assembly "Project Assembly"), and more!
    * If you would like to hear even more details regarding the narrative, please check out this video: [What you need to know about the Story in Satisfactory](https://youtu.be/899Owtx-vz8).
  * [Patch 2018-10-11](/wiki/Patch_2018-10-11 "Patch 2018-10-11"): Made available.
