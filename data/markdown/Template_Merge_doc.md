[[purge](https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Template:Merge/doc?action=purge)]

This template is used to suggest that a page should be merged with a different article. 

This template will add tagged pages to [Category:Pages to be merged](/wiki/Category:Pages_to_be_merged "Category:Pages to be merged"). 

## Usage

`{{[Merge](/wiki/Template:Merge "Template:Merge")|Destination page|Reason}}`

Replace "destination page" above with the suggested article to merge with, and replace "reason" with a short description of the reason for doing so. The reason is technically optional, but omitting it is discouraged. 

This is the documentation page, it should be transcluded into the main template page. See [Template:Doc](/wiki/Template:Doc "Template:Doc") for more information.
