# Tutorial:Independency

**Independency** is a gameplay strategy where factories do not depend on each other, removing the need to distribute resources and manage connections between them. Instead of importing many raw resources from afar and handling the distribution of intermediate products, each product is made "from scratch." Factories become spread across the world.

## Overview

Throughout the entire game, new components are introduced. These rely on simpler components. Intuitively, you might think you can use parts you're already producing to make new parts. For example, in Tier 1: 

  * You automate [](/wiki/Iron_Plate "Iron Plate") [Iron Plates](/wiki/Iron_Plate "Iron Plate") and [](/wiki/Iron_Rod "Iron Rod") [Rods](/wiki/Iron_Rod "Iron Rod").
  * Then you realize the need to automate [](/wiki/Reinforced_Iron_Plate "Reinforced Iron Plate") [Reinforced Iron Plates](/wiki/Reinforced_Iron_Plate "Reinforced Iron Plate"), so you decide to produce them using the existing setup. You have fewer Plates and Rods left, but some are still piling up.
  * Soon enough, [](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor") [Rotors](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor") need to be automated. With few Iron Rods remaining, you have to either produce very few Rotors or expand the production of Iron Rods.
  * Later, once you decide to automate [](/wiki/Motor "Motor") [Motors](/wiki/Motor "Motor"), you realize your Rotor production is lacking. At this point, you end up doing a lot of backtracking to figure out what part of the production line needs to be expanded. While it seems easier to "just use existing Rotors," the rebuilding involved can get overwhelming.



The problem boils down to tediously managing the distribution of Iron Rods, a basic component. 

The concept of decentralizing instead aims to make each factory as independent as possible. This gives you the freedom to decide how much of each component to produce without being restrained by the output of other factories. The result is also a significant simplification of logistics. 

## Factories

Each factory is built to be as independent as possible. Components are produced from raw resources. A factory can have different outputs. It is logical to group them if they have some relation between them, such as a common input. For example, a factory producing Reinforced Iron Plates and Rotors makes more sense than a factory for [](/wiki/Concrete "Concrete") [Concrete](/wiki/Concrete "Concrete") and [](/wiki/AI_Limiter "AI Limiter") [AI Limiters](/wiki/AI_Limiter "AI Limiter"). 

In practice, you decide either how much of a raw resource you want to use as input, or how much of the target component(s) you desire as output. 

### Size

Unintuitively, it may appear that making every product from scratch leads to bigger factories. However, this is not true: in order to produce the same amount of products, the same amount of factory buildings is needed. 

For example, instead of a large common iron [Smelter](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter") setup whose output is distributed between several "smaller" factories, each factory has its own proportional iron Smelter setup. 

### Location

The ideal location for any factory is near the raw resources it uses. As the game progresses, it is increasingly unlikely that all resources will be nearby. This either caused by them being used by other factories, or their availability in the world ([](/wiki/Crude_Oil "Crude Oil") [Crude Oil](/wiki/Crude_Oil "Crude Oil"), [](/wiki/Bauxite "Bauxite") [Bauxite](/wiki/Bauxite "Bauxite") and [](/wiki/Nitrogen_Gas "Nitrogen Gas") [Nitrogen Gas](/wiki/Nitrogen_Gas "Nitrogen Gas") are notable examples). In that case, decide which resources to import from elsewhere and transport long-distance. 

### Target outputs

Except for the early game, only building materials and consumables need to be produced. Only roughly 10-20 of each item per minute should suffice. There are some notable exceptions, such as [](/wiki/Concrete "Concrete") [Concrete](/wiki/Concrete "Concrete") used for building [foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations"), for example. 

See [Category:Building materials](/wiki/Category:Building_materials "Category:Building materials") and [Category:Equipment materials](/wiki/Category:Equipment_materials "Category:Equipment materials"). 

### Preventing rebuilding

Because each factory is self-sufficient and does not need to account for the required input of other factories, there is no need to rebuild or expand as the need to automate new parts arises. Of course, this is difficult without having completed the game first and knowing what's to come next. You may optionally choose to rebuild a factory once new [alternate recipes](/wiki/Alternate_recipes "Alternate recipes") are unlocked, however, this is not a roadblock in progression. 

## Main base and central storage

It is convenient to have the output of all factories easily accessible in one location, in so-called central storage. As each factory is independent, central storage is the final destination. Thus, it is ideal to have the HUB and Space Elevator set up here. 

A main base can also have multiple otherwise independent factories near each other, which makes it easy to transport their output to central storage. 

The need to haul resources used by pioneers around can be alleviated using [Dimensional Depot Uploaders](/wiki/Dimensional_Depot_Uploader "Dimensional Depot Uploader"). 

## Exceptions

It is reasonable to make exceptions to the independency approach as desired. You might want to avoid transporting Crude Oil over long distances, set up Aluminum Ingot production in one location, or have a shared Steel Ingot smeltery for nearby factories. 

These ultimately boil down to personal preference. The point is that the approach does not have to be followed strictly.
