**Stingers** are spider-like creatures found mostly in [caves](/wiki/Cave "Cave") and jungles. Their body consists of four pointy legs attached to their torso, and another 4 similar pointy appendages attached to their head, which they use for combat. They move very swiftly and come in three variants. 

**Warning** : Spider-like images in this article. If you have [Arachnophobia](/wiki/Arachnophobia_mode "Arachnophobia mode"), please do not click the tab "Arachnophobia Mode Off". Clicking the "Arachnophobia Mode Off" tab will show the infoboxes for Stingers which contain spider-like images.

Arachnophobia Mode OnArachnophobia Mode Off

Activating the ["Arachnophobia Mode" option](/wiki/Settings "Settings") replaces the Stinger models with three sprites of cats with an animated hologram filter, to make the stinger visuals more palatable for those with arachnophobia. The cat sprites do correspond to a Stinger variant.

### Spawn

  * Baby Stingers are the most common, and are often seen accompanying both Alpha and Elite Gas Stingers.
  * The Alpha Stinger occurs more frequently in caves, and are seen in later-game biomes such as the [Red Bamboo Fields](/wiki/Red_Bamboo_Fields "Red Bamboo Fields") _(elevated center part of the map)_ , and the [Swamp](/wiki/Swamp "Swamp").
  * Elite Gas Stingers can also be found in caves, however are mostly seen later-game biomes like the swamp area of [Red Jungle](/wiki/Red_Jungle "Red Jungle") _(elevated center part of the map)_ , and the [Swamp](/wiki/Swamp "Swamp").



## Behavior

Stingers aggressively attack the pioneer or other creatures by clawing. Alpha and Elite Gas stingers can also leap up over 50 meters up/forwards. 

Stingers make scuttling insect-like sounds when moving (unless in arachnophobia mode, as noted below).[2]

Stingers tend to zigzag and run in circles when moving, attempting to distract pioneers. This can be potentially dangerous when they are attacking in groups. 

The leaping attack from Alpha and Elite Gas Stinger has friendly fire: they can hurt or even kill each other. This only happens when the Stinger is attacking the Pioneer and accidentally hurts the nearby creatures. 

### Climbing

Alpha and Elite Gas Stingers will climb on each other to reach the pioneer, which can occasionally lead to them falling from a cliff edge. Alpha and Elite Gas Stingers have the ability to climb on almost vertical surfaces, as well as the ability to climb trees and Lookout Towers. They cannot climb on vertical surfaces with negative gradients, such as cliff overhangs. When facing sharp edges, unlike Hogs and Spitters, they can climb downwards. 

### Spawning

Stingers usually spawn in groups, with Alpha and Elite Gas Stingers sometimes spawning alone. Some Stinger spawn points only work during night-time, making some areas more hostile during the night. 

Stingers can be prevented from spawning either by using [creature respawn prevention methods](/wiki/Creatures#Respawning "Creatures") or by using [Advanced Game Setting for Disable Arachnid Creatures](/wiki/Advanced_Game_Settings#Creatures "Advanced Game Settings"). 

### Against Other Creatures

Stinger will prioritize attacking the [Pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer") but will attack any other hostile creature ([Fluffy-tailed Hogs](/wiki/Fluffy-tailed_Hog "Fluffy-tailed Hog"), [Spitters](/wiki/Spitter "Spitter"), [Cliff Hogs](/wiki/Cliff_Hog "Cliff Hog") and their variants) when the Pioneer isn't available. They do not attack [Flying Crab Hatchers](/wiki/Flying_Crab_Hatcher "Flying Crab Hatcher") or flying crabs. This can be observed by watching from outside detection distance, setting creature behavior to Passive (or Retaliate without striking anything), or sitting in a [vehicle](/wiki/Vehicles "Vehicles"). The attacked creature will retaliate against the offending stinger(s). If the attacked creature is part of a group, the entire group may retaliate together. 

  * Baby Stingers cannot kill anything on their own. They will die in one hit of retaliation.
  * Alpha and Elite Gas Stingers will use their leap attack on other creatures.
  * Elite Gas Stingers will use their [poison gas](/wiki/Poison_Gas "Poison Gas") attack on other creatures. Be careful if observing nearby outside a vehicle, as the gas will damage the pioneer.
  * Elite Gas Stingers can kill multiple creatures with ease, but will fall to [Cliff Hogs](/wiki/Cliff_Hog "Cliff Hog") and [Nuclear Hogs](/wiki/Nuclear_Hog "Nuclear Hog").



## Tips

  * If subtitles are enabled, 'Quick Footsteps' will be displayed if a Stinger is moving. Before they attack, it will display 'Slash'. Their leaping attack is subtitled 'Leaping'.



### Combat

  * If other types of hostile creatures are nearby, wait out of detection. They will fight, damage, and kill each other. This leaves the survivors with less HP to deal with.
  * All types of Stingers are completely immune to the damage of [poison gas](/wiki/Poison_Gas "Poison Gas"), so are unaffected by [Gas Nobelisk](/wiki/Gas_Nobelisk "Gas Nobelisk") explosions.



#### Baby Stingers

  * Individual Baby Stingers can be dealt with very easily, as they deal minimal damage and requires just two hits from either [](/wiki/Xeno-Zapper "Xeno-Zapper") [Xeno-Zapper](/wiki/Xeno-Zapper "Xeno-Zapper") or [](/wiki/Xeno-Basher "Xeno-Basher") [Xeno-Basher](/wiki/Xeno-Basher "Xeno-Basher").
  * It can be hard to hit them with ranged weapons due to their small size, fast movement, and tendency to circle around the player before and between attacks. However, if you spot them at a distance before they become aware of you, or line up a shot as they turn and charge directly at you before their slash attack, the [](/wiki/Rebar_Gun "Rebar Gun") [Rebar Gun](/wiki/Rebar_Gun "Rebar Gun") with basic ammo will kill them in a single shot; A [](/wiki/Rifle "Rifle") [Rifle](/wiki/Rifle "Rifle") equipped with [](/wiki/Homing_Rifle_Ammo "Homing Rifle Ammo") [Homing Rifle Ammo](/wiki/Homing_Rifle_Ammo "Homing Rifle Ammo") can also effectively take out Baby Stingers.
  * Baby Stingers can be an easy, safe source of [](/wiki/Alien_Protein "Alien Protein") [Alien Protein](/wiki/Alien_Protein "Alien Protein"), due to their tendency to spawn in large numbers and how easy they are to kill; beware of Alpha and/or Elite Gas Stingers that often accompany them though.



#### Alpha and Elite Gas Stingers

  * Slide-jumping is incredibly useful to dodge their attacks.
  * [Blade Runners](/wiki/Blade_Runners "Blade Runners") make dodging their attacks and keeping distance much easier.
  * A [Rebar Gun](/wiki/Rebar_Gun "Rebar Gun") with Stun Rebar is very helpful to get in close without the danger of their slash. [Nobelisks](/wiki/Nobelisk_Detonator "Nobelisk Detonator") are easier to land when the Stinger is stunned.
  * Ranged Weapons like the [Rifle](/wiki/Rifle "Rifle") with Turbo or Homing Ammo and [Rebar Gun](/wiki/Rebar_Gun "Rebar Gun") with Explosive or Shatter Rebar can make the fight much easier to deal with.
  * Make sure you have plenty of healing items in case you are hit due to the high damage of their attacks, and prioritize dodging. Remember that [Medicinal Inhalers](/wiki/Medicinal_Inhaler "Medicinal Inhaler") have a small delay before they heal you.
  * It is possible to shoot them from a place they cannot leap up to, like a cliff or bridge. Be careful that they can't actually get to you as their leap can go very high!
  * They cannot fit through the openings in Conveyor Walls. If they can be boxed in or if the cave can be blocked with Conveyor Walls then they can be dispatched using ranged weapons with little danger.
  * Similarly, they can often get caught on trees, especially when trying to use their leap attack on you. If you can position some trees between you and the stinger, it may get caught in a loop of trying to leap and running into the tree repeatedly, allowing you to unload ammunition into it at your leisure (remember not to use explosives!). This is especially the case against the Elite Gas Stingers, due to their much higher rate of leaping.
  * The slash attack has a large frontal AoE, and usually cannot be dodged by walking backwards; it will oftentimes damage the player even if the spider's claws didn't physically hit the player. It can be dodged much more easily by side-stepping instead.



#### Specific

  * Alpha Stingers can be countered by circling around them, forcing them to use their slash attack, allowing the player to dodge it easily and deal damage.
  * Elite Gas Stingers leap much more often, which can be exploited with some practice to kill them earlier into the game. Use [Blade Runners](/wiki/Blade_Runners "Blade Runners") to circle and keep distance, then slide-jump to the side as they leap. If you bring your attention directly back to the Stinger, you can then hit their large hitbox with a [Rebar Gun](/wiki/Rebar_Gun "Rebar Gun") loaded with Stun Rebar as they land. Perform another slide-jump directly back towards them for plenty of free hits with your weapon of choice (6 hits with a [Xeno-Basher](/wiki/Xeno-Basher "Xeno-Basher") are possible) before they lose the Stun Rebar's effect.



### Arachnophobia Mode

While Arachnophobia Mode is enabled: 

  * The hitbox isn't changed
  * The cat sprites do not dim and can always be seen clearly, even in dark environments
  * The movement sound is silenced and their attack/idle sounds are replaced by cat sounds (loud meows) 
    * This does not affect environmental subtitles.
  * Without the attack animations and specific sounds, it can be more difficult to notice and dodge their attacks.

## Trivia

  * Compared to the size of an [Explorer](/wiki/Explorer "Explorer"): 
    * Baby Stingers are as big as the explorer's wheels.
    * Alpha Stingers are as big as roughly half the explorer.
    * Elite Gas Stingers are slightly larger than Alpha Stingers.
  * There are three total cat sprites seen while Arachnophobia mode is enabled, two of which are from the same cat. It has been confirmed that both cats belong to Coffee Stain developers.[3]
    * The cat replacing Baby Stingers is named Siri and belongs to Sofi Spranger, CSS Concept Artist.[4][5]
    * The cat replacing Alpha and Elite Stingers was named Féja and belonged to Nathalie Verweij, CSS UI/UX Designer.[4] Sadly, Féja passed away on 23 November 2023.[6]
  * The internal names for the four kinds of Stingers are called "CaveStinger_Child", "Stinger_Child", "EliteCaveStinger" and "EliteStinger". This naming scheme is misleading, as the "CaveStinger" is an indicator as to whether or not a stinger will spawn during the day time.[1]
  * Alpha Stingers occasionally miss a hit if the pioneer is exactly underneath their body.
