## Usage

[Buildings](/wiki/Buildings "Buildings") _(other than indicated below)_ can be freely placed within the Blueprint Designer's boundary. Afterwards, the arrangement can be saved as a blueprint by interacting with the Designer. Buildings placed within the Blueprint Designer can be quickly dismantled from the Designer's UI, placing the returned materials into an attached storage box. 

### Blueprint Build Menu

  * Once built, other Blueprints can be placed in the Blueprint Designer from a tab in the [build menu](/wiki/Build_Gun "Build Gun") when building a New Blueprint. 
    * Pillars can partially intersect the edges of the Blueprint Designer.
  * The Blueprint Build Menu comes with a Default "Undefined Category" that all new Blueprints Modules will be saved to unless explicitly specified during Blueprint Save Process. [1]
  * During the Blueprint Save Process additional Blueprint Menu Categories and Sub-Categories can be added as desired.
  * Using the Blueprint Build Menu, and by clicking the **+** icon that appears when you mouse over a desired blueprint, you can add a Blueprint to the [To-Do List](/wiki/To-Do_List "To-Do List").



### Building Restrictions

Some buildings, due to various reasons related to type and size, may or may not be placed in a specific Mark Level Blueprint Designer, as shown below: 

Building  | Mk.1  | Mk.2  | Mk.3  | Remarks   
---|---|---|---|---  
[The HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB") | X | X | X | [note 1]

[Empty Platform (Plain/With Catwalk)](/wiki/Empty_Platform "Empty Platform") | X | ✓ | ✓ |   
  
Notes: 

  1. ↑ 1.0 1.1 There can be only one.
  2. ↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 Extractors need to snap to Resource Nodes.
  3. ↑ Water Extractors extend below Blueprint Designer Pad.
  4. ↑ Quantum Encoders can fit inside if placed diagonally as [shown here](https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Quantum_Encoder#/media/File:Quantum_Encoder_Diagonal.png), but this may not be a desireable orientation to work with.
  5. ↑ Alien Power Augmenter will expand when placed in Blueprint Designer, and thus needs more room then default size.



## Blueprint Designer Control Bench

The Blueprint Designer Control Bench acts as the "front" of the Blueprint.[2]

### User Interface

  * The Blueprint Designer Control Bench UI has fields to enter data related to: [3]
    * **Blueprint Module Name**.
    * **Blueprint Description**.
    * **Directory** \- Category / Sub-Category in Build Menu where Blueprint Module will show up.
    * Icon Settings for: 
      * **Icon** to be used for this Blueprint Module.
      * **Background Color** to be used for Icon.
  * NOTE: Blueprint Categories and Sub-Categories are part of the Save Game.[4]



### Storage Box

  * The Blueprint Designer has a **Blueprint Storage Box** located on the Blueprint Designer Control Bench. [5]
  * The Pioneer can add items to and remove items from the Blueprint Storage Box.
  * When loading a Blueprint Module the Blueprint Designer will: 
    * First look in the Blueprint Storage Box for the required materials.
    * If the Blueprint Storage Box does not have enough of the required materials the Pioneer's Personal Inventory is then checked. 
      * The Pioneer must have required materials in their personal inventory when placing items to create new blueprints[6]
  * When editing a Blueprint Module and a part of a Blueprint is dismantled the Blueprint Designer will: 
    * First try to place the materials in the Blueprint Storage Box.
    * If the Blueprint Storage Box is full then the materials are placed in the Pioneer's Personal Inventory.
    * In the event both the Blueprint Storage Box AND the Pioneer's Personal Inventory are full then an [Overflow Crate](/wiki/Crate "Crate") is created and placed near the Blueprint Designer Control Bench.



## Blueprint Files

Blueprints are made using a Blueprint Designer. 

_Main article:_[Blueprint](/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint")

## Tips

  * Can be used to create curved sections of Foundations which eases the z-fighting.
  * Can be used to create blueprints of floating structures, such as floating Ceiling Mounted Wall Outlets.



## Narrative

**Expand to reveal spoiler**

When performing specific actions, the player will hear [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA") speak. 

  * View [Story Player Actions - Pioneer Constructs](/wiki/Story#Player_Actions "Story") to read and hear individual ADA messages related to constructing a Blueprint Designer.



## Trivia

  * The platform of the Designer is 1 meter tall and the frame extends an additional meter above the top of the Designer, making the total height 34 meters.
  * Despite having a terminal in its model, the Blueprint Designer can be interacted with from any angle.
