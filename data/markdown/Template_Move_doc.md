[[purge](https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Template:Move/doc?action=purge)]

This template is used to suggest that a page should be moved (renamed) to a different title. Since there are no special rights required for page moves, this should be used only when a page move should be discussed first. 

The exception is images, which do require special rights for moves. This can be used on image pages even for routine moves. 

This template will add tagged pages to [Category:Pages to be moved](/wiki/Category:Pages_to_be_moved "Category:Pages to be moved"). 

## Usage

`{{[move](/wiki/Template:Move "Template:Move")|new title|reason}}`

Replace "new title" above with the suggested title for the page, and replace "reason" with a short description of the reason for doing so. The reason is technically optional, but omitting it is discouraged. 

This is the documentation page, it should be transcluded into the main template page. See [Template:Doc](/wiki/Template:Doc "Template:Doc") for more information.
