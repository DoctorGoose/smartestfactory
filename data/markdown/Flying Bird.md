### Behavior

Neutral

The so-called **Flying Bird,** currently only known by this internal name from the game files, subtly graces the skies of the [world](/wiki/World "World"). First observed in [Update 4](/wiki/Patch_0.4.0.0#World "Patch 0.4.0.0"), this small dragon-like creature often goes unnoticed by the [pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer") due to its seamless integration into the environment, adding a subtle yet dynamic presence to the game's diverse ecosystem. Part of the update's new ambient VFX, the Flying Bird is triggered by an automated proximity-based system to spawn them near the pioneer, adding a subtle yet dynamic presence to the game's diverse ecosystem.

## Habitat

Flying Birds are predominantly found in lush, verdant environments. Their presence is a common sight in areas like [Grass Fields](/wiki/Grass_Fields "Grass Fields") or the [Northern Forest](/wiki/Northern_Forest "Northern Forest"), adding to the game's rich and immersive natural scenery. 

## Appearance

This creature features a sturdy torso that flows into a slightly pronounced head, presenting a silhouette that's as streamlined as it is charming. Its wings, grandiose and wide, flaunt a captivating dance of pinks and oranges, reminiscent of a sunrise over the game's lush [biomes](/wiki/World#Biomes "World"). 

Its belly, a soft cream, provides a subtle contrast to the vibrant wing hues, rounding out a color scheme that could very well be the envy of the game's [flora](/wiki/Flora "Flora"). A delicate peach graces its robust body, complementing the environmental palette of the [Grass Fields](/wiki/Grass_Fields "Grass Fields") and [Northern Forest](/wiki/Northern_Forest "Northern Forest") where this creature is often spotted. 

## Behavior

The Flying Bird is neutral and often observed in larger groups during the day, flying away from and generally ignoring the pioneer. Importantly, these birds cannot be killed nor can the player interact with them, underlining their role as a passive environmental feature in the game. At night, these birds typically become elusive, except for a group of up to 7 birds that consistently accompany the [Giant Flying Manta](/wiki/Giant_Flying_Manta "Giant Flying Manta"). This special behavior, seen both during the day and at night, highlights their unique relationship with the Manta and adds a fascinating dimension to the skies. 

Additionally, Flying Birds appear to be unaffected by [Poison Gas](/wiki/Poison_Gas "Poison Gas"), as they are often observed flying through these hazardous clouds, demonstrating a certain resilience or adaptation to the [world's](/wiki/World "World") environment.
