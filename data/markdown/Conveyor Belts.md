**Conveyor Belts** are structures used to transport items between buildings. They come in six marks with different building costs, throughput, and appearance. Conveyor Belts can only be built between building connection ports or [Conveyor Poles](/wiki/Conveyor_Poles "Conveyor Poles"). Placing down a Conveyor Belt on the ground automatically places a Conveyor Pole with it.

## Characteristics

### Item transportation

Once a Conveyor Belt is connected to a [building](/wiki/Building "Building")'s output (such as a [Miner](/wiki/Miner "Miner")), it will begin to pull items out from the building's output slot. Conversely, a belt connected to a building's input port will attempt to push items into its input slot, provided it accepts the supplied item and there is enough storage space. Items on the belt can be manually picked up [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). Items cannot be manually dispensed onto a belt; this can be done by constructing a temporary [Storage Container](/wiki/Storage_Container "Storage Container"). 

If the belt doesn't lead anywhere, items will not fall off the belt, instead, they will simply stop on the belt. The same occurs if the connected building is either full or cannot accept the item on the belt. 

Belts cannot transport items in stacks, each item (visually) on the belt represents one item. Lower mark Belts can also cause bottlenecks especially in the early game, where Miners are capable of producing more items per minute than the belt can transport. 

Each mark has higher throughput (measured in items/min) than its predecessor, and also appears more visually advanced.

### Pioneer transportation

_Main article:_[Movement](/wiki/Movement "Movement")

Besides serving their primary purpose of transporting items, Conveyor Belts also move [pioneers](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer"). The transportation speed roughly matches how fast items are moving on the belt. 

| Speed  
(Standing) | Speed  
(Running with Blade Runners)   
---|---|---  
Mk.1  | 1.2 m/s   
4.32 km/h | 52.92 km/h   
Mk.2  | 2.4 m/s   
8.64 km/h | 57.24 km/h   
Mk.3  | 5.4 m/s   
19.44 km/h | 68.04 km/h   
Mk.4  | 9.6 m/s

56.16 km/h | 104.76 km/h   
Mk.6  | 24 m/s

## Construction

A single Conveyor Belt segment can be from ~0.5 up to 56 meters long (exactly seven [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations")), calculated using the [euclidean distance formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance#Higher_dimensions "wikipedia:Euclidean distance") (Δx)2+(Δy)2+(Δz)2. The minimum turn radius is two meters. The building cost is roughly 0.5 materials per meter, rounded up to nearest integer. 

The maximum slope is 35°, calculated using arctan⁡zx2+y2 (in degrees, where x, y, and z are the belt's displacement on the axes). Conveyor Belts cannot incline along the Z-axis while turning in the XY plane. They will do one, then the other. The greatest possible rise in the shortest distance is 31 meters vertically and 45 meters horizontally. 

When building between poles, the first snapping point will always be the input and the second the output, unless the first point is connecting to an input of another building or conveyor belt. Once constructed, the belt cannot be reversed, but can be directly up/downgraded into other conveyor marks by aiming at them with the other mark. 

Belts can be built on top of some buildings, such as [Constructors](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor"), provided there is a valid spot on which a conveyor pole can be automatically placed. They can also intersect each other, some non-colliding entities, and terrain freely. 

Conveyor Belts have three construction modes: Default, Straight and Curve. Different build modes can be cycled by either pressing or holding [`R`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). 

  * Default: The default build mode.
  * Straight: This build mode only constructs belts with straight lines and 90° turns, except when placing a belt in such a way that in and output are in the same direction but a few meters apart in which case it creates an S-shape.
  * Curve: The conveyor belt will be curved in a way similar to [railways](/wiki/Railway "Railway"), according to the position and orientation of the starting and ending points.



### Placement errors

#### Encroaching other's clearance

This means the belt is being constructed through other buildings. Conveyors have to be always constructed second, after the buildings they are being connected to are already built, with two exceptions: 

  * The second Conveyor Pole can be built alongside the belt, once it is snapped to one end
  * [Conveyor Splitters](/wiki/Conveyor_Splitter "Conveyor Splitter") and [Mergers](/wiki/Conveyor_Merger "Conveyor Merger") can be built on existing belts, but this doesn't respect the foundation grid.



This error may occur due to directional errors, such as connecting a building's output to another building's output. 

#### The floor is too steep

This means the floor below where the Conveyor Pole would be built is too uneven. Using a flat surface, such as a Foundation, could help. 

#### The conveyor belt is too short/long/steep

Refer to § Construction above. 

### Belt welding

The maximum length of 56 meters per segment can be bypassed by doing the following in sequence: 

  * First build 2 segments of belts end-to-end
  * Remove the belt support at the joint
  * Place a [Merger](/wiki/Merger "Merger") at the joint
  * Dismantle the Merger
  * The 2 belt segments are now welded into a single segment. Use this method to extend the belt length.



## Tips

  * Conveyor ports on buildings display whether they are output or input. Outputs have green **〕** arrows, inputs have orange **≡** symbols.

## Trivia

  * Conveyor Belts were first showcased in the [Conveyor Belt Speeds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeYAFCJ0N3I) teaser in 2018. 
    * In the video, Conveyor Belts can be clearly heard from further away (especially higher marks), but they are quite quiet in-game.
    * A Mk.6 Conveyor Belt can be seen in the video, which was not released until version 1.0.
  * A single item occupies roughly 1.186 meters on a belt. 
    * 843 items fit on a belt 1000 meters long.
  * Marks 1-3 show the belt reversed at the underside. Marks 4-5 have metal on the bottom, but still, show the reversed belt when clipped through. Higher tiers of belts generally have guards at the edges to protect items (and the [pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer")) from slipping off the sides. Take note this does not totally protect the pioneer though, as one can be slingshot out from sharp turns.
  * Conveyor Poles supporting a Conveyor Belt can be deconstructed without affecting the now-floating belt.
  * Conveyor Belts themselves are drawn via a custom shader implemented to support the "spline" meshes to be instanced; the items are instanced meshes, making them expensive to update.
  * Items on a Conveyor Belt Mk.1 are out of sync from the top animation and can move at different speeds.



## Current issues

  * TSR can cause visual issues (bug), mitigated by the `r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering 0` [console command](/wiki/Console "Console").
  * Straight mode can create some graphical glitches.[1]
  * Straight mode can sometimes cause the belt to become further and further strewed to one direction the further out it goes, usually after a turn, this can be mitigated by placing a conveyor support angled correctly in front of your current conveyor line

  * [Patch 0.3](/wiki/Patch_0.3 "Patch 0.3"): Greatly nerfed the pioneers' walking and running speed on belts, making belt-launched jetpack flight inefficient. (work around by using [Hyper Tube Cannon](/wiki/Hyper_Tube_Cannon "Hyper Tube Cannon"))
  * [Patch 0.1.15](/wiki/Patch_0.1.15 "Patch 0.1.15"): Increased the capacity of Mk.4 and Mk.5 belts from 450 to 480 and 660 to 780 items per minute respectively.
  * [Patch 0.1.14](/wiki/Patch_0.1.14 "Patch 0.1.14"): Made Conveyor Belt Mk.5 available alongside [Conveyor Lift Mk.5](/wiki/Conveyor_Lift "Conveyor Lift").



## Early game development

Prior to Closed Alpha, conveyor belts were added in Sprint 2 (week 4), and continued to be improved during early development.
