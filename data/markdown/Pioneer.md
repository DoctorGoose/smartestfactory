## Points of view

The game is played from first-person unless driving a [vehicle](/wiki/Vehicles "Vehicles") or traveling with the [Hyper Tube](/wiki/Hyper_Tube "Hyper Tube"), where the camera transitions to a third-person point of view.[2]

## Body size

The standing Pioneer has a hitbox size of about 0.8 m x 0.8 m x 1.8 m. While crouching, it is about 0.8 m x 0.8 m x 0.8 m. When sliding, the height is reduced to 0.8 m. 

## Inventory

_Main article:_[Inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory")

Each Pioneer has an inventory, accessed with [`Tab ↹`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). It has two parts: 

  * Storage (often referred to as "Pocket Dimension" in-game) 
    * Can be used to carry solid items, but not fluids
    * Contained items can be used for [building](/wiki/Build_Gun "Build Gun") and manual crafting at the [](/wiki/Craft_Bench "Craft Bench") [Craft Bench](/wiki/Craft_Bench "Craft Bench") and [](/wiki/Equipment_Workshop "Equipment Workshop") [Equipment Workshop](/wiki/Equipment_Workshop "Equipment Workshop")
    * Its size increases through various unlocks
  * Equipment slots 
    * There are five types: hand, body, back, head, legs
    * Each equipment can be worn in its respective slot
    * Additional hand slots can be unlocked, but other types are fixed at 1



## Health

_Main article:_[Health](/wiki/Health "Health")

Pioneers have 100 HP. Health depletes through attacks of other players, hostile creatures or the environment ([Poison Gas](/wiki/Poison_Gas "Poison Gas"), [radiation](/wiki/Radiation "Radiation"), fall damage). It slowly regenerates, and can be rapidly regained by eating food or using [Medicinal Inhalers](/wiki/Medicinal_Inhaler "Medicinal Inhaler"). 

Satisfactory has friendly fire, meaning pioneers are able to [hurt](/wiki/Combat "Combat") each other in multiplayer using their weapons. Pioneers may also revive [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") dead pioneers, so that they respawn on the spot without having to teleport to, and journey back from, the [HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB") (or world starting location if the HUB is not built). 

## Interaction

Pioneers can interact with [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). The default interaction range is 3.5 m, which increases to 20 m while hovering using a [Hover Pack](/wiki/Hover_Pack "Hover Pack") or gliding with a [Parachute](/wiki/Parachute "Parachute"). 

Interacting performs a different action based on the target: 

  * Dropped items are instantly picked up
  * Foliage is instantly picked up, yielding resources such as [](/wiki/Leaves "Leaves") [Leaves](/wiki/Leaves "Leaves"), [](/wiki/Wood "Wood") [Wood](/wiki/Wood "Wood"), and [](/wiki/Mycelia "Mycelia") [Mycelia](/wiki/Mycelia "Mycelia")
  * [](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug") [Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug"), [](/wiki/Somersloop "Somersloop") [Somersloops](/wiki/Somersloop "Somersloop") and [](/wiki/Mercer_Sphere "Mercer Sphere") [Mercer Spheres](/wiki/Mercer_Sphere "Mercer Sphere") are picked up, but the key must be held down.
  * [Resource nodes](/wiki/Resource_node "Resource node") of solid resources initiate manual mining
  * Functional [buildings](/wiki/Buildings "Buildings") open their menu, through which they can be configured, such as by setting a recipe, clock speed, vehicle loading or routes, etc., also showing useful information, such as their operating status or contents
  * [Vehicles](/wiki/Vehicles "Vehicles") (except [](/wiki/Drone "Drone") [Drones](/wiki/Drone "Drone")) are entered, allowing them to be driven



## Emote

The Pioneer can perform an emote by holding the emote [`T`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") key, then picking one of the actions below. Emotes can also added to the [Hotbar](/wiki/Hotbar "Hotbar") by holding the Emote Wheel key, hovering over an "action", and pressing the desired Hotbar Slot key. 

Clap | Twirl | Facepalm | Rock | Paper   
---|---|---|---|---  
[](/wiki/File:Clap_Emote.png) | [](/wiki/File:Twirl_It_Emote.png) | [](/wiki/File:Facepalm_Emote.png) | [](/wiki/File:Rock_Emote.png) | [](/wiki/File:Paper_Emote.png)  
Clap the hands two times  
(contains [Easter egg](/wiki/Easter_egg "Easter egg")) | Twirl the [Build Gun](/wiki/Build_Gun "Build Gun") in hand |  |  |   
Scissors | Point | Wave | Heart | Finger Guns   
---|---|---|---|---

|  |  |  |   
  
The Finger Guns emote was originally a [FICSMAS 2021](/wiki/FICSMAS "FICSMAS"), Day 24 Reward, but became available as standard in 1.0. 

## Model

[](/wiki/File:Version_1.0_Pioneer_-_Full.png)

[](/wiki/File:Version_1.0_Pioneer_-_Full.png "Enlarge")

New Pioneer Model as of Version 1.0.

The Pioneer's look (model) was developed prior to [Closed Alpha](/wiki/Alpha_Test_Weekend "Alpha Test Weekend") and remained the same up through [Update 8](/wiki/Update_8 "Update 8"). In Version 1.0 the look of the Pioneer Model was dramatically changed and improved.[Model 1]

  * Sometime during game development prior to Version 1.0, with the exception of the Pioneer's Helmet, **the high-poly version of the Pioneers main body was lost**[Model 2][Model 3][Model 4][Model 5] leaving only a low-poly version that could be updated and as a result a new high-poly version was created.[Model 6]
  * Some of the general changes in Version 1.0 were removal of wrinkles and addition of more detail. The overall color is not washed out like before, and the improvement of the suit reflectors will now appear more bright when illuminated by the [Flashlight](/wiki/Flashlight "Flashlight"). The harness straps no longer clip into the body of the Pioneer.
  * The pioneers model was remade in order to introduce character customization.[Model 7]

This explains how the Pioneer is able to control the [Jetpack](/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack") and [Hover Pack](/wiki/Hover_Pack "Hover Pack") during flight.

## Customization

## Trivia

  * The pioneer automatically sits down when the player disconnects. (Either in multiplayer mode, or even in singleplayer, due to offline mode).
  * All the player controlled FICSIT pioneers are women.[7]
  * The pioneer's e-mail address and presumably the employee number can be seen in the [Codex](/wiki/Codex "Codex"): _"employee.05192.83.3845.710.8.192b@ficsit.biz"_. In a multiplayer game, the email doesn't change.
  * The pioneer will never become hungry as there is no hunger system in the game, food is instead used to regain [health](/wiki/Health "Health").
  * While the idea of customization was suggested as early as 2018, the ability to customize the Pioneer was not implemented until the 1.0 release, alongside the Pioneer model being remade.[8][3][9][Model 7]
  * It is possible that the pioneer's name is either Becky or Monica.[10]
  * It is equally likely the pioneer's name or nickname is Bry based on the coffee cups that can be found in the HUB and Space Elevator,[11][12] although this has not been confirmed.[13]
  * In order to work at FICSIT, Inc. you must prove your dedication to the job - all Pioneers have to legally change their name to "Pioneer".[14]
  * When running [`⇧ Shift`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), the normal running animation will sometimes be replaced with Naruto Run, which is only visible to other players.
  * When running [`⇧ Shift`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), crouching [`C`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), and jumping [`Space`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") as the pioneer hits the ground, a significant boost to the speed of the next jump is gained. This does not work on steep slopes. This technique is known as [slide jumping](/wiki/Movement#Slide_jumping "Movement").
  * The warning shown after receiving damage reads "DAMAGE TO FICSIT PROPERTY DETECTED" when above 3 health segments, or "IMMINENT DESTRUCTION OF FICSIT PROPERTY DETECTED" when below. 
    * This either means that FICSIT values the Pioneers' uniforms more than their lives, or that Pioneers are FICSIT property.
  * When hostile fauna's AI starts aggravating on the Pioneer, there is a warning saying "Unauthorized Hostility Towards FICSIT Pioneer Detected"
  * The Pioneer's age is not yet known.[15]
  * On April 1, 2021, the April Fools Special Event was introduced. This event was repeated on April 1, 2022 and April 1, 2023. During all three events, the Pioneer's Head / Helmet appeared larger.
  * The 'Clap' emote can be used to toggle the nearby [Lights](/wiki/Lights "Lights") on and off.
  * The reflection on the helmet is most likely HDRI_Epic_Courtyard_Daylight, a default Unreal Engine Texture Cube used in reflective objects most of the time unless lumen is on. 
    * The same texture is used in the [Crude Oil Blob](/wiki/No_item_in_foliage "No item in foliage")
  * Switching to the Golden Helmet, closing the customizer, opening it again, and switching back to another helmet gives any helmet of your choice the golden finish. This is lost upon reloading and a possible bug.
