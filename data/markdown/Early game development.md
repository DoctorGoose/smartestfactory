Game Jam Prototype that inspired the development of _Satisfactory_

This article covers the development of _[Satisfactory](/wiki/Satisfactory "Satisfactory")_ from the game's inception to the release of the Closed Alpha. 

_Satisfactory_ started development as a game jam game.[1][2][3] According to [CSS UI/UX Designer Nathalie Verweij](/wiki/Coffee_Stain_Studios#Coffee_Stain_Studios "Coffee Stain Studios") the Game Jam Game in 2016 was called "Base Defense" which inspired a new game that eventually became "Satisfactory" in 2018.[4]

The first year (52 weeks) of game development was done in "sprints" of 2 weeks each[S1 1] with a development team that initially consisted of 16 individuals.[S1 2]

## Early gameplay

A lot of the early game systems, like those related to equipment, build gun, building, etc., were based on previous game development in the Sanctum Series.[S8 1]

Much of the early game allowed you to build and mine anywhere. By Sprint 6 (week 12) this ability was being evaluated, along with looking at the scale and experience of the game to see if that is what they wanted.[S6 1]

In Sprint 12 (week 24), using [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (Interact) outlined the building or machine being interacted with.[S12 1] Additionally at this time with the introduction of the Portable Miner, combined with the hand-mining ability, the development team began to consider things like how fast or slow should mining be. [S12 2]

In Sprint 20 (week 40) the use of the "build effect" was seen.[S20 1]

Sometime between Sprint 20 and Sprint 23 (week 46) the name of the game of "Satisfactory" was added to Main Menu.[S23 1]

By Sprint 26 (week 52), the individual buildings and production lines looked much like they do now but more "cartoony".[S26 1][PA 1]

## [Biomass](/wiki/Biomass "Biomass")

With the addition of the biomass burner generator after 40 weeks of development came the ability to collect biomass from foliage.[S20 3]

In Sprint 20 (week 40) the ability to collect biomass by using [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") was introduced. Collected biomass was used in a biomass burner generator and had an initial Stack Size of 100. 

In Sprint 26 (week 52) with more foliage to interact with, there were more places to collect Biomass, to include removing trees without the aid of a chainsaw.[S26 2]

## [Paleberry](/wiki/Paleberry "Paleberry")

In Sprint 26 (week 52), at the end of early development, the paleberry bush was introduced.[S26 3] and looked like a snail or worm with hanging fruit. Each paleberry bush could have two to four berries shown but you could only pick up 2 using [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls").

## [Pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer")

The Pioneer model changed as the game developed. 

In the beginning, and shown in Sprint 1 (week 2), the game used the default Unreal Engine mannequin.[S1 3]

By Sprint 12 (week 24) there had been some work on the Pioneer model,[S12 4] and by Sprint 26 (week 52) the Pioneer model had received even more improvements.[S26 4]

### Points of view

Most of the time in early development the Pioneer used only first person view, but later the ability to use both first and third person views were allowed as part of a test. 

In Sprint 20 (week 40) the Pioneer used only third Person view to get more feedback from CSS "players".[S20 2]. They did for a while have a way to switch from first person view to third person view.[S20 4]. 

In Sprint 23 (week 46) the Pioneer now used only first person view as part of getting more feedback.[S23 3]

In Sprint 26 (week 52) the Pioneer could be switched from first person view and third person view by using the [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") (MMB).[S26 5][PA 3]

### Health

In Sprint 8, when taking damage, like from Poison Gas, you would hear sound effect like someone punching you, and would see blood splatter on the HUD (visor).[S8 4]

Even after 36+ more weeks of development, prior to Closed Alpha, while the "damage" sound was changed, when taking damage, from falling, or Poison Gas, or Creatures, you would still see the blood splatter on the HUD _(albeit a bit less graphic)._[PA 4][PA 5][PA 6]

## [HUD](/wiki/HUD "HUD")

The Heads Up Display (HUD) developed as the game developed. 

In Sprint 8 (week 16) the HUD saw some major improvements. Some of the changes noted was the use of a Hotbar near the bottom for Build Gun, Pickaxe, and Nail Gun, and a Health Bar located in the upper right.[S8 4]

By Sprint 12 (week 24), the Hotbar had been removed, and replaced with a Compass.[S12 5] Activiation of the in-game escape/pause menu would also show an early version of the To-Do List on the left, and current Controls on the right. 

By Sprint 23 (week 46) the HUD Compass had been improved but still appeared on the bottom.[S23 3] Also during Sprint 23 there was the use of a Health Bar and Stamina Bar.[S23 4] The Stamina Bar would decrease as you sprinted. The Stamina Bar was removed before Early Access (Update 1) release. 

By Sprint 26 (week 52) the Compass had been moved to the top of the HUD.[S26 2]

During Pre-Alpha (week 52 and after), the To-Do List could be activated by using [`⇧ Left Shift`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") while hovering over Build Menu item.[PA 7]. The To-Do List would appear in the upper left corner of the HUD.

## [Jetpack](/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack")

A basic "Jetpack" or flying mode was first used in Sprint 3 (week 6)[S3 2] which allowed flying without using any equipment like the Jetpack. While removed in Closed Alpha, it was re-introduced in Update 8 in the form of the [Advanced Game Settings Flight Mode](/wiki/Advanced_Game_Settings#Gameplay "Advanced Game Settings"). 

  * [](/wiki/File:Sprint_3_-_Jetpack.png "Sprint 3 - Early Flying Function \(Green Usage Bar\)")

## [Jet Boots](/wiki/Blade_Runners "Blade Runners")

In Sprint 20 (week 40) the use of Jet Boots to help in jumping was shown[S20 5] which most likely led to creation of the [Blade Runners](/wiki/Blade_Runners "Blade Runners") in later game development. 

  * [](/wiki/File:Sprint_20_-_Jet_Boots.png "First appearance use of Jet Boots")

First appearance use of Jet Boots




## [Game menus](/wiki/Game_menus "Game menus")

For most of the first year of game development there were no game menus other than individual menus for Build Gun or buildings. 

### Main menu

By Sprint 23 (week 46) the early game started using a Main Menu which included the game name Satisfactory, along with an improved in-game escape/pause menu.[S23 1] The Main Menu at this time consisted of: 

  * Continue (New)
  * Play
  * Load
  * Multiplayer
  * Options
  * Mods
  * Exit



Prior to Closed Alpha the Main Menu defaulted to the Swedish language[PA 8] but could be changed to local native language by clicking on "Val" (Choice) which opened the game options (settings) menu. 

### Escape menu

In Sprint 12 (week 24) an in-game escape menu was used[S12 6] which consisted of the menu, along with an early version of the To-Do List on the left, and the current Controls on the right. The In-Game Escape-Pause Menu consisted of: 

  * Resume
  * Respawn
  * Save
  * Main Menu
  * Exit



In Sprint 23 (week 46) the improved in-game escape menu at this time had "Pause" on top and consisted of the following menu items (changes in **bold**): 

  * **Pause** (on top)
  * Resume Game
  * **Load Game**
  * Save Game
  * **Options**
  * Exit To Main Menu
  * Exit To Desktop
  * Respawn _(moved down to bottom)_

## [Controls](/wiki/Controls "Controls")

The first look at the keybinds for the Controls was seen in Sprint 12 (week 24)[S12 6] when activating the escape menu (see above), and consisted of the following: 

Keyboard/mouse  | Function  | Other function/note   
---|---|---  
[](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_None.png "None") | Move Camera  | Not re-bindable   
[`W`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") | Move Forward  |

[`R`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") | Reload when gun is empty  |   
[`Q`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") | Dismantle Mode when needed  |   
  
## [Inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory")

The display of the Inventory changed as the early game was developed. 

At the beginning of game development in Sprint 1 (week 2) the Inventory consisted of just 16 fillable slots in a 4 by 4 grid.[S1 4]

By Sprint 12 (week 24) the look of the Inventory dramatically changed with the use of a brown background for inventory items, and the inclusion of Body Slots on top for Hands, Back, and Head. 

In Sprint 20 (week 40) the look of the Inventory had changed with removal of brown background and addition of an Equipment Section placed below it with 3 slots for Head, Hands, and Back. 

Prior to Closed Alpha, the Inventory pop-up looked the same, but the ability to split items in half by using [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right") (RMB) was seen.[PA 9]

## [Ping](/wiki/Ping "Ping")

Since Sprint 3 the Ping Function [`Alt`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") \+ [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") (LMB) had been available[S3 3] and displayed a large "X" on location being pinged instead of the current exclamation point "!" which was however shown in the Compass. The Ping Function was imported from [Sanctum](https://store.steampowered.com/app/91600/Sanctum/), also produced by Coffee Stain Studios. 

Prior to Closed Alpha the Ping Function was improved to show a colored diamond ⬙ with bottom half filled in the Compass. A different diamond color could be assigned to each co-op player in a multiplayer session.[PA 10]

## [Resource Scanner](/wiki/Resource_Scanner "Resource Scanner")

The ability to scan for resources was added early in game development, but illustrated in Sprint 12 (week 24).[S12 6] The scan marked nearby resources using small colored laser spikes going up, but did not show there location on the Compass. The color of the spike determined what type of resource it was. Green might have been Stone (Limestone). 

In Sprint 26 (week 52), and prior to Closed Alpha, the ability to scan for specific resources was added where by using [`F`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") you opened a radial menu and had to pick an item to scan for.[S26 6][PA 12]

The "scan" graphic effect was changed to be similar to what happens now. After a ping, you would see the location of the specific resource scanned for appear in the Compass (but did not show distance). Individual Resource Nodes was indicated on the Compass by the use of a circle ◯, and a 3-letter abbreviations for Resources, like "IRN" for Iron, "CPR" for Copper" and "STN" for Stone (Limestone). 

If close by, during the scan, the Pioneer would see a line flash with each ping and a white marker placed on the Resource Node.[PA 13]

## [Build Gun](/wiki/Build_Gun "Build Gun")

The Build Gun first appeared in game by Sprint 6. 

In Sprint 3 (week 6) the Build Menu could be accessed using [`B`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (for Build Gun).[S3 4] The Dismantle Mode use to be selectable in the Build Menu but later that ability to select it was removed and replaced by simply using [`F`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). 

### Sprint 3

### Sprint 26

By Sprint 26 the Build Menu continued to improve[S26 7] and in some situations show buildable's in red that could not be built due to insufficient parts in the Pioneers Inventory. 

The Build Menu changed the tabs at the top, and with the exception the removed items and the QR Code in Transport[note 1], the tabs consisted of the following sub-menu selectable items (new items in **bold**):

In Sprint 26 it was shown the devs had access to a "Cheat Board" to help in testing game development.[S26 8] This was removed by Closed Alpha. 

  * [](/wiki/File:Sprint_26_-_Cheat_Board.png "Cheat Board \(used during development\)'")

Cheat Board _(used during development)'_




### Pre-Alpha

After Sprint 26 but before Closed Alpha the Build Menu was changed to make it more simplified. The Build Menu was still opened using [`B`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") followed by selecting a tab and item to build.[PA 14] The Build Menu continued to show buildable's in red that could not be built due to insufficient parts in the Pioneers Inventory. 

Instead of having a separate Menu item for dismantle, the Build Menu used a hammer and wrench icon was used to activate the dismantle function.[PA 15]

While maintaining most of Sprint 26 Build Menu for individual selectable items (see above), the menu tabs at the top change, and with the exception of the removed tabs [note 1], consisted of the following: 

Group  | Item  | Remarks / Notes   
---|---|---  
Production  | _(See Sprint 23)_ |   
Power  | [note 2]  
Transport  | [note 2][note 3]  
Organization  |   
Trading Post  | [note 4]  
  
Notes: 

  1. ↑ Removed Tabs and Items noted were, None (Tab) and Beacon (Item), Cheat (Tab)
  2. ↑ 2.0 2.1 Power was moved to Tab 2, and Transport moved to Tab 3.
  3. ↑ Mk.6 Conveyor Belts were removed by Closed Alpha.
  4. ↑ The Trading Post Menu return after Sprint 26 but was removed in Closed Alpha.

## [HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB")

For most of the early game development there was no HUB. 

### Sprint 12

In Sprint 12 (week 24) they added an equivalent of the HUB called a Trading Post.[S12 7]

#### Market

The Trading Post had a "Market" that allowed player to unlock things and progress in the game by selling items and buying upgrades you wanted.[S12 8]

Individual Items has a VALUE using a virtual currency of "Rubles", based on currency used in in the [Sanctum](https://store.steampowered.com/app/91600/Sanctum/) game also produced by Coffee Stain Studios, as shown in the following examples: 

  * Nail Gun (272 Rubles)
  * Stone Brick (6 Rubles)
  * Wire (1 Ruble)
  * Cable (5 Rubles)
  * Portable Miner (0 Rubles)
  * Standard Cartridge (11 Rubles)
  * Fuel (9 Rubles)
  * Jetpack (2000 Rubles)



The Trading Post had two Conveyor Input Ports that could be connected to some Production Lines that would allow you to automatically sell items without having to drag them from your inventory.[S12 9] This was replicated in later game development by use of both the [AWESOME Sink](/wiki/AWESOME_Sink "AWESOME Sink") and [AWESOME Shop](/wiki/AWESOME_Shop "AWESOME Shop") introduced in Update 3. 

The Market had a menu which included the following categories:[S12 10]

Market Menu Item

Factory Organization.   
Resource Processing.   
Part Manufacturing.   
Automatic Mining + Conveyor Belt.

### Sprint 20

By Sprint 20 (week 40) The Trading Post (HUB) had greatly improved in the 4 months (16 weeks) since Sprint 12.[S20 6]

The Trading Post now had a description of _The Trade Post is the heart of your base. You will put in orders for schematics which you pay for with specific parts._

#### Tech Onion

Early game had an equivalent of the HUB Terminal and Milestones that was called the "Tech Onion"[S20 7] which consisted of a set of rings for individual tier levels starting at Tier 1 in the center and moving to higher tier levels as you moved outward. 

The Tech Onion was proposed by CSS UI/UX Designer Nathalie Verweij.[8]. 

Starting in Sprint 12, the game had an economic aspect where you would sell parts to get Rubles (a Sanctum Reference) which were used to purchased upgrades in the Tech Onion. By Sprint 20 this function had been removed.[S20 8]

The individual tier levels, milestones, and unlocks, were as follows: 

Tier  | Milestone  | Unlocks   
---|---|---  
Tier 1  | First  | Portable Miner   
Smelter   
Biomass Burner   
_Other Unknown_  
Second  | Miner

Conveyor Belt   
_Other Unknown_  
Third  | Advanced Constructor

_Other Unknown_  
_Other Unknown_  
Tier 4  | Ninth  | Complex Constructor   
Expanded Storage Container   
Computer   
  
#### Tier progression list

Sprint 20 showed the Tier Progression list.[S20 8]. 

It was noted that Iron Rods had the following information: 

  * Description: "Iron Rod is one of the most common Iron parts. It's used in most early game buildings."
  * Total Stack Size: 50

### Sprint 26

In Sprint 26 (week 52) the Trading Post saw more improvements in the 3 months (12 weeks) since Sprint 20.[S26 9]

The Workbench (Craft Bench) during this time still looked like a forge, and required you to click once for each "craft action" which was jokingly called the "break your finger version". 

#### Tech Onion

The equivalent of the HUB Terminal and Milestones called the "Tech Onion" still existed in Sprint 26, and added 8 more tiers (5 to 12).[S26 10] The Tech Onion was abandoned prior to Closed Alpha in favor of a simplified schematic system used for tier progression (see below). 

Some of the interesting milestones noted in Sprint 26 were the following: 

  * Tier 8 - Industrial Smelting where you unlocked the Basic Smelter Mk.2 and [Smelter Mk.2](/wiki/Old_unreleased_content#Mk.2_variants_of_buildings "Old unreleased content")(which became the Foundry).
  * Tier 8 - Quartz Crystals where you unlocked ability to collect Quartz Crystals which later became Power Slugs.[S26 11] You also unlocked Crystal Oscillator.
  * Tier 10 - Electric Foundation which gave you Foundations that transmitted power.
  * Tier 11 - Advanced Assembly Line where you unlocked [Assembler Mk.2](/wiki/Old_unreleased_content#Mk.2_variants_of_buildings "Old unreleased content"), [Manufacturer Mk.2](/wiki/Old_unreleased_content#Mk.2_variants_of_buildings "Old unreleased content"), and [Conveyor Belt Mk.6](/wiki/Old_unreleased_content#Conveyor_Belt_and_Lift_Mk.6 "Old unreleased content").

#### Configuration

The Trading Post configuration screen had the following areas: 

  * Tabs showing Schematics, Inventory, and Trading.
  * Timer in red showing the amount of time before Trade Ship returns.
  * Ship showing Trade Ship Inventory sent next via the Trade Ship to pay (purchase) the active Schematic.
  * Storage used to store items prior to placement in Trade Ship Inventory.
  * Schematic Active shown just below Tabs and to right of Storage.

#### Schematics

The Tech Onion used previously was replaced with a simplified schematic system used for tier progression.[PA 17]

Schematics could be activated and then paid for (purchased) by sending the required parts via the Trade Ship.[PA 18]

When a schematic purchase was completed by the sending of the Trade Ship the player would be notified by an on-screen notice in orange.[PA 19]

The following tiers and schematics were available:

## [Craft Bench](/wiki/Craft_Bench "Craft Bench")

In early game development there was an equivalent to the Craft Bench called a **Workbench** which had the description of _Time to do some manual labor_ when selected in the Build Menu. 

In Sprint 6 (week 12) there was a Workbench, accessible from the Build Menu[S6 5] that later became the Craft Bench. 

To craft (produce) more advanced items you moved items from inventory to a 3 by 3 grid _(similar to_ [_Minecraft_](https://www.minecraft.net/) _)_ and held down [`Space`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") key to craft item. This "movement" from Inventory to Workbench Menu was later reevaluated and determined the extra step was not needed, leading to its removal from the game.[S6 6]

In Sprint 20 (week 40), the Trading Post came with an early version of the HUB Craft Bench which was called Workbench that looked like an old time forge with fire.[S20 9] You could also build another free standing Work Bench _(two words)_ that could be used by the pioneer or another co-op player. 

The Trading Post Workbench craft menu in Sprint 20 contained the following selectable items: 

Item  | Cost   
---|---  
Iron Ingot  | 2 Iron Ore   
Iron Plate  | 2 Iron Ingot   
Iron Rod  | 1 Iron Ingot   
Iron Screw  | 1 Iron Rod   
Iron Cog  | 1 Iron Plate   
Copper Ingot  | 2 Copper Ore   
Wire  | 1 Copper Ingot   
Cable  | 3 Wire   
Stone Brick  | 4 Stone _(Limestone)_  
  
After Sprint 26, but before Closed Alpha, the Trading Post replaced old time forge used before with a Workbench.[PA 20]

The Trading Post Workbench enabled you to make items that could be hand crafted by selecting recipe and manually clicking on the [Produce] button which would show blue along with a lighter blue progress bar showing the crafting progress immediately below it. If you didn't have the ingredients in your inventory you would see a [Can't Produce] button in gray. 

Another free standing Workbench could be created if desired to be used by the pioneer or another co-op player.

## [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations")

The foundation during game development had only one type and had the description of _A solid foundation to build on_ when selected in the Build Menu[S8 6] and could be built using 1 Stone Brick. 

In Sprint 8 (week 16) the foundation used in the early game was based on similar foundations used in the Sanctum Series.[S8 1]

By Sprint 12 (week 24) the look of foundations changed to include the 1 meter "grid" markings.[S12 11]

In Sprint 23 (week 46), 22+ weeks since Sprint 12, the look of foundations had improved and came in five types of thin and thick which are presumed to be the 1 Meter and 2 Meter Foundations, four types had a solid version and a version elevated on "legs", and one type was a special version. Also the Ramp _(only one type)_ was introduced.[S23 5]

In Sprint 26, 6+ weeks since Sprint 23, foundations continued to come in five types as before, but the special version was called Mega Foundation 1a presumed to be 4 normal foundations in one buildable.[S26 12]

In Pre-Alpha foundations had yellow guidelines for placement of walls and other buildable's[PA 21] and could be built using 2 Cement.

## Floor

The Floor first appeared during Sprint 8 (week 16), had only one type, used the description of _Expand your factory along the Z-axis!_ when selected in the Build Menu[S8 7] and could be built using 1 Stone Brick. 

In Sprint 23 (week 46), 30+ weeks since Sprint 8, floors came in five types including one type that looked like a wire grid which is presumed to be related to the Powered Wall.[S23 5]

By Sprint 26 (week 52), 6+ weeks since Sprint 23, floors came in only 4 types, one of which was the "wired floor". 

Floors, including the wired floor, were removed in Closed Alpha in favor of using only foundations, and removal of the Powered Wall.

## [Stair](/wiki/Foundations#Stairs "Foundations")

Not much is know about the development of the stair prior to Closed Alpha. 

In Sprint 23 (week 46) the build menu showed a stair.[S23 5]

In Sprint 26 (week 52), 6+ weeks since Sprint 23, the build menu showed the stair and the addition of a stair 2.[S26 12]

The wall first appeared during Sprint 8 (week 16), had only one type, used the description of _Lets build a wall_ when selected in the Build Menu[S8 7] and could be built using 4 Iron Plate. 

By Sprint 23 (week 46), 30+ weeks since Sprint 8, walls has significantly improved and now appeared in two types, FICSIT and Metal.[S23 5] Also at this time there was a Powered Wall with a description of _Power the whole building using this neat little thingy!_

By Sprint 26 (week 52), 6+ weeks since Sprint 23, the Powered Wall had been removed.[PA 21]

### [Fence](/wiki/Walls#Other "Walls")

In Sprint 26 the build menu showed a Fence_01 which presumably is the start of development of the Modern Railing.

## [Resource Node](/wiki/Resource_Node "Resource Node")

Resource Nodes were added as the game developed. Early on the look was more like large boulders but eventually were flattened to become what they look like now in game. 

In Sprint 1 (week 2) we got the first look at resource nodes, one iron node and one coal node.[S1 5]

By Sprint 6 (week 12), mineable resource nodes had a Purity Percentage of 100%[S6 7] as compared to mining same resource anywhere else (see Resource Deposit - Sprint 6) and the amount of resource nodes in the environment was procedurally generated.[S6 8]

In Sprint 8 (week 16), mineable resource nodes, in addition to having varied purity levels (impure, normal, pure), also had **finite resources** which could be depleted.[S8 8] This applied to both when hand mining and when using Miners. 

Even in Sprint 26 (week 52) and prior to Closed Alpha, resource nodes continue to have finite resources.[S26 13]

### Resource deposit

In early game development there were no resource deposits (only resource modes), but you did have the ability to mine anywhere for resources. 

### Extraction

Ore extraction could be done either by hand mining, or use of a Portable Miner, or full Miner. 

In Sprint 6 (week 12) the Pioneer had access to the Pick Axe[S6 9] for hand mining. The Pickaxe later became the Hand Chisel (or Chisel). 

With the Pickaxe, after selecting from the Mine Menu shown on the left, you had the ability to hand mine anywhere and not on a specific Resource Deposits or Resource Node. The mining speed (number of hits with Pickaxe) was based on Purity Percentage with higher percentages being able to be hand mined faster (fewer hits) while lower percentages being able to be hand mined slower (more hits). 

In Sprint 26 (week 52), like the Workbench during this time, hand mining required you to click for each "mine action" in what was jokingly referred to as the "break your finger version".[S26 14]

#### Mine list

Early on, when equipping the Pickaxe it displayed a Mine List[S6 10] shown in a box on the upper right which also shows the Purity Percentage for each type of resource available which consisted of: 

  * Coal.
  * Iron.
  * Bauxite.
  * Copper.
  * Stone (Limestone).
  * Crude Oil.



#### Hand mining mini-game

During early game development the Pioneer could use a hand mining mini-game during which they had to click at just the right time in order to give them greater amounts _(based on purity)_ then clicking at other times.[S26 15]

After Sprint 26 but before Closed Alpha, the hand mining mini-game was improved, and only allowed resource extraction by clicking on [PICK] button during a specific time when the arrow was in the blue section which decreased in size with each rotation.[PA 22] This resource hand mining mini-game got faster and faster the longer you hand minded. 

The hand mining mini-game was removed in Closed Alpha when it was decided that resource nodes would have infinite amounts regardless of purity level.

## [Portable Miner](/wiki/Miner#Portable_Miner "Miner")

Approximately 6 months into game development, by Sprint 12 (week 24), the Portable Miner was introduced.[S12 2]

In Sprint 20 (week 40) it is noted that the Portable Miner now had a stack size of 1.[S20 10]

## [Miner](/wiki/Miner "Miner")

The Miner was the first buildable created for the game.[S1 6]

In Sprint 1 (week 2), the first version of the Miner was a simple block[S1 6] that could be placed on a Resource Node (Coal or Iron). This version of the Miner also include inventory with the "burnt bacon" Coal Icon.[S1 4]

By Sprint 2 (week 4), the second version of the Miner was a vast improvement over the "block" used in Sprint 1, and used a animated unpainted shell that included two conveyor belt output ports.[S2 1]

In Sprint 3 (week 6), the Miner could be selected using the Build Menu. The Miner build hologram could not be rotated, but the Miner could be placed on a Resource Nodes.[S3 5] Additionally the Minor saw some graphical improvements to include adding color (green stripe). 

In Sprint 6 (week 12) the Miner's model received more improvement by addition of color, could be placed anywhere, not just on Resource Nodes.[S6 11] The Miner's placement used a two-step process, [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") click to place, followed by using [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") (Scroll) to rotate into position.[S6 12] You selected which resource to mine from the Miner's UI. 

By Sprint 26 (week 52), and before Closed Alpha, after 40+ more weeks of development, the Miner's model had improved greatly, but still initially looked much different than the current design.[PA 23] Eventually the Miner's look was changed to be similar to the Mk.1 Miner.[PA 24]

The cost for the Miner was 15 Iron Rods, 12 Iron Plate, 12 Wire. 

The Miner's UI was very simple showing only the extractor status, extraction progress bar, and if powered or not.[PA 25][PA 26]

If not connected to a conveyor belt, the max a Miner could extract was 50 Ore at which point it would stop.[PA 27]

## [Oil Extractor](/wiki/Oil_Extractor "Oil Extractor")

The early game had an equivalent of the oil extractor which was called a oil pump. 

In Sprint 6 (week 12) the oil pump had the description of _Gets them fluids out of the ground_ when selected in the Build Menu.[S6 13] and could be build at the cost of 10 Iron Pipe and 10 Iron Plate. The Oil Pump could be build anywhere and not only on specific Oil Resource Nodes and extracted oil rich ore.

## [Conveyor Belts](/wiki/Conveyor_Belts "Conveyor Belts")

Conveyor belts were added in Sprint 2, and continued to be improved during early development. 

In Sprint 2 (week 4) the conveyor belts was nothing more than a block that could be placed in a spline.[S2 2]

By Sprint 3 (week 6), the conveyor belt started using a animated unpainted shell.[S3 6]

In Sprint 6 (week 12) conveyor belts had the description of _Moves them resources where you want them to go_ when selected in the Build Menu[S6 14] and could be built at the cost of 2 Iron Pipes (using burnt bacon icon). 

By Sprint 8 (week 16) conveyor belts saw some improvements in both design and placement[S8 9] and could be built using only 1 Iron Pipe (now with proper icon)/ 

By Pre-Alpha, 36 weeks since Sprint 8, the look of conveyor belts had improved significantly[PA 28] and could now be built using 1 Iron Plate instead of Iron Pipe. The conveyor belts could be dragged from output (or input) to anywhere, along with the ability to build them directly on the ground with an automatic starting conveyor pole.[PA 29] Conveyor belts at this time did not have the automatic ending conveyor pole, but free floated in the air.

## [Conveyor Poles](/wiki/Conveyor_Poles "Conveyor Poles")

Conveyor poles were added in Sprint 6, and during most early game development was very simplistic in design. 

In Sprint 6 (week 12) conveyor poles were selectable via the Build Menu[S6 15] and had the description of _Buld conveyors in the air_ (misspelling in menu). Early game conveyor poles consisted of a basic "T" design with a green attachment block and had a cost of 1 Iron Pipe (using burnt bacon icon) and 1 Iron Plate. 

In Sprint 8 (week 16), placing conveyor poles on Foundations allowed for better placement[S8 9] and improved construction of conveyor belts. Conveyor poles still cost 1 Iron Pipe (now with proper icon) and 1 Iron Plate. 

By Pre-Alpha, 36 weeks since Sprint 8, the look of conveyor poles had improved significantly[PA 30] and could now be built using 2 Iron Rods, 1 Iron Plate, and 2 Cement. The conveyor belts could be dragged from output (or input) to anywhere, along with the ability to build them directly on the ground with an automatic starting conveyor pole. In addition to the ability to rotate conveyor poles using [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle"), the conveyor poles could be raised several meters prior to placement of conveyor belts.

## [Conveyor Splitter](/wiki/Conveyor_Splitter "Conveyor Splitter")

Early game development had a conveyor splitter in a "Y" configuration with one Input and two Outputs. 

In Sprint 3 (week 6) the conveyor Splitter started by dividing input in half.[S3 7]

In Sprint 6 (week 12) the conveyor splitter had the description of _Splits stuff_ when selected in the Build Menu[S6 16] and could be built using 3 Iron Pipe and 3 Wire. 

In Sprint 23 (week 46), the conveyor splitter graphic mesh and look had drastically changed.[S23 5]

## [Smart Splitter](/wiki/Smart_Splitter "Smart Splitter")

In Sprint 23 (week 46) the early game had a Splitter Advanced, with two outputs, that became the smart splitter.[S23 5]

By Sprint 26 (week 52), the splitter advanced was now called Smart Splitter[S26 7] and had a description of _This Splitter lets you define a part that should be split to a specific side. All other parts that pass through will output to the other side._

## [Conveyor Merger](/wiki/Conveyor_Merger "Conveyor Merger")

In early game development there was a Conveyor Hub which in reality was a 7:1 conveyor merger. 

In Sprint 3 (week 6) the conveyor bub was a buildable that would combine 7 input conveyor belts into 1 output conveyor belt.[S3 8] Early on the Miner produced less, so the idea was to have multiple Miners connected to a central Conveyor Hub. 

In Sprint 6 (week 12) Conveyor Hubs had the description of "Hub that merges 7 conveyor belts" when selected in the Build Menu[S6 16] and could be built using 3 Iron Plate and 5 Copper Ingot. 

By Sprint 23 (week 46), the conveyor hub still existed, but there was also now a conveyor merger.[S23 5]

In Sprint 26 (week 52), the conveyor hub was now called Mega Conveyor Merger and the conveyor merger was called Basic Conveyor Merger.[S26 7]

## Manufacturing Plant

In early game development there was not a dedicated [Smelter](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter"), [Constructor](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor"), or [Refinery](/wiki/Refinery "Refinery"), but that function was combined in a multi-purpose Manufacturing Plant which had a description of _Makes basic parts_. 

The "function" of the manufacturing plant was determined by the recipe chosen in the menu. What the manufacturing plant was being used for was displayed on the above the output port. The manufacturing plant was sometimes referred to as the "Darth Vader Helmet" building.[S3 9]

In Sprint 3 (week 6) the manufacturing plant was introduced and used as a Smelter[S3 10], but the build cost was unknown _(reference shows confusing information)_. 

By Sprint 6 (week 12) the manufacturing plants "functions" were split into other buildable's with the exception of the constructor which still used the same graphic. The individual "functions" at this time did not have mark levels but _that_ was being considered.[S6 17]

## [Smelter](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter")

In Sprint 6 (week 12) smelters become its own buildable and had the description of _The long awaited smelter_ when selected in the Build Menu. 

Smelters were selectable via the Build Menu, had a black color and looked like a "face", and could be built using 6 Iron Plates and 8 Stone Bricks.[S6 18] These early Smelters had two Inputs and during production the "mouth" was animated during production.[S6 19]

In Sprint 26 (week 52) the game still had two types of Smelters[S26 16] which included the standard Basic Smelter and the Mk.2 Smelter (Basic Foundry).[S26 17]

During Pre-Alpha, when building a basic smelter the hologram had one input (green) and one output (orange).[PA 31]

The basic smelter UI consisted of two tabs. 

  * Input and Output - Showed production status consisting of ore being inputed and ingots being outputted. If no conveyor belt was connected to either input or output the appropriate section would display red. Additionally there was a Power Status notification if no power was applied.[PA 32]
  * Recipes - Showed the available recipes to choose from.[PA 33]

## [Manufacturer](/wiki/Manufacturer "Manufacturer")

Not much is know about the development of the manufacturer prior to Closed Alpha. 

In Sprint 20 (week 40) the early game had a building called "Complex Constructor" with the description of _The Complex Constructor takes three or four parts and turns them into one other part._[S20 1]

## Wind Turbine

Early game development had access to Wind Turbines for power generation. These were eventually abandoned, due to the ability to place anywhere (nothing to deal with), and replaced with the use of [Geothermal Power Generators](/wiki/Geothermal_Generator "Geothermal Generator") which are limited to being only used on Geysers.[9]

In Sprint 3 (week 6) power was supplied by wind turbines which were eventually replaced by Geothermal Generators.[S3 11]

By Sprint 6 (week 12) in addition to Coal Power, the early game still used Wind Turbines.[S6 3]

In Sprint 20 (week 40), after 40 weeks of development, wind turbines were removed and replaced by biomass burners.[S20 11]

## [Biomass Burner](/wiki/Biomass_Burner "Biomass Burner")

In Sprint 20 (week 40) the biomass burner generator was introduced and its use shown.[S20 11]

During Sprint 26 (week 52), and after, the biomass burner generator saw some improvements[PA 35] and used a simplified UI consisting of both Fuel Quantity and Power Status. The biomass burner generator could be built using 15 Iron Plate, 15 x Iron Rod, and 20 Wire.

## [Power Poles](/wiki/Power_Poles "Power Poles")

In Sprint 20 (week 40) the Power Pole was added to the game at the same time as biomass burner generators[S20 12] and mentioned in the description that _Each pole can handle can handle up to 4 connections and up to 50 MW flowing through it._

In Pre-Alpha, 12+ weeks since Sprint 20, the Power Pole look was improved.[PA 36]

## [Power Line](/wiki/Power_Line "Power Line")

Early on, Power Lines did not need [Cable](/wiki/Cable "Cable") to be crafted in order to use, but could be placed as needed. 

In Sprint 3 (week 6) the use of Power Lines required aiming and clicking on the Power Connectors on individual Buildings.[S3 12] Additionally there was the ability to daisy-chain power from building to building.[S3 13]

By Sprint 20 (week 40) Power Lines still required aiming and clicking on the Power Connectors on individual Buildings, did not require the use of Cable, but when a "connection" between two Power Connectors was made there was a "power up sound" that was also heard.[S20 12] The ability to daisy-chain power from building to building was removed with the addition of Power Poles. 

In Sprint 26 (week 52) and after, connecting the Power Line would show a large voltage ⚡ symbol above building or machine power connectors</ref>[PA 37] and require the use of Cable. After the connection is made the player would hear a bit of static sound.

## [Power Slug](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug")

In the early game development there were no power slugs, but instead there were Quartz Crystals which were used in production of items. Quartz Crystals, which eventually became power slugs, is the reason a power slug could be turned into a [Power Shard](/wiki/Power_Shard "Power Shard"). 

In Sprint 23 we got a glimpse of the Quartz Crystals placed in the world.[S23 6]

In Sprint 26 (week 52), in the Tech Onion Tier 8, Quartz Crystals, you unlocked ability to collect Quartz Crystals which later became power slugs.[S26 11]

## [Walker](/wiki/Walker "Walker")

In Sprint 6 (week 12) the Walker, an enemy from [Sanctum](https://store.steampowered.com/app/91600/Sanctum/) also produced by Coffee Stain Studios, was seen.[S6 24] became the first random hostile creature to appear in the game. 

In Sprint 8 (week 16) the Walker continued to be a random hostile creature found in the world.[S8 2]

The Walker was finally relegated to just one instance in the [Abyss Cliffs](/wiki/World#Abyss_Cliffs "World") and was eventually removed from the game sometime in Update 3.

## [Spitter](/wiki/Spitter "Spitter")

Sprint 26 (week 52+), or prior to Closed Alpha, the Spitter was the third creature to be added.[PA 38] The spitter at this time had only one look, and did not have the "variants" that were added in [Update 6](/wiki/Patch_0.6.0.0#Creatures "Patch 0.6.0.0"). 

The Spitter's fire attack consisted of 4 fire balls that exploded on contact, which could damage both the pioneer and vehicles if hit. The initial look of the fire ball explosions looked much like molten lava.

## [Rebar Gun](/wiki/Rebar_Gun "Rebar Gun")

In Sprint 6 (week 12) the player had access to a nail gun[S6 25] which later became the rebar gun. 

In Sprint 20 (week 40) the look of the nail gun changed as seen in the Trading Post Tech Onion for Tier 2, fourth milestone,[S20 7] and in Pre-Alpha Trading Post Schematics for Tier 3 Exploration Basics,[PA 17] which showed the nail gun and its single ammo of nailgun spike. 

The nail gun was equipped in the single hand slot by accessing the inventory.[PA 39]

## [Truck](/wiki/Truck "Truck")

Sprint 12 (week 24) the Truck was first seen and had a basic but developed design.[S12 12]

There are indications, when looking at the escape menu, that the truck was initially called a "car" and it took multiple parts in order to make. [S12 13]

Item  | Cost   
---|---  
Car (Truck)  | 1 Tire, 1 Engine, 1 Truck Chassis, 1 Car Computer   
Tire  | 4 Vulcanized Rubber, 2 Reinforced Steel Plate

## [Tractor](/wiki/Tractor "Tractor")

The Tractor was the second vehicle, after the Truck, that appeared in the game during early development.[S20 13]

In Sprint 20 (week 40) the early version of the Tractor looks much like it does now but when driving it also had "speedometer" showing how fast you were going along with what "gear" you were in. You also saw what grid coordinate you were in _(displayed below the Speedometer)_ along with an improvement to the compass on the bottom. 

By Pre-Alpha, 12+ weeks since Sprint 20, the Tractor improved a little bit.[PA 40]. 

The Tractor had a Workbench accessible in the back in which you could craft or store items, and also was used to fuel the vehicle. 

One of the primary purposes of the Tractor was its use while exploring the world. While manually driving the Tractor, on the left of the HUD, was shown fuel status and use along with current speed in kilometers per hour (KMH), and vehicle damage status (health). 

While driving the Tractor the Pioneer could not get hurt from hostile indigenous lifeforms.[PA 4].

## [Truck Station](/wiki/Truck_Station "Truck Station")

in Sprint 23 (week 46) Truck Stations were first seen, despite Trucks and Tractors added first in early game development.[S23 7] Initially truck stations only had a "Load" function.

## Trains

In Sprint 23 (week 46) trains were first shown.[S23 8] Trains at this time were very basic in both design and function, and consisted of the ability to build an [Electric Locomotive](/wiki/Electric_Locomotive "Electric Locomotive"), [Freight Car](/wiki/Freight_Car "Freight Car"), [Train Docking Station (Freight Platform)](/wiki/Freight_Platform "Freight Platform") and [Track (Railway)](/wiki/Railway "Railway"). 

### Electric Locomotive

The early version of the Electric Locomotive was very basic to include block representations of two train engineers.[S23 9]

### Freight Car

While buildable in Sprint 23, there was no information or image showing their use. 

### Freight Platform

In Sprint 23 the Freight Platform was called Train Docking Station which had a very basic design with one Input (Unload) Port and one Output (Load) Port.[S23 10]

### Railway

The first version of the Railway was a design consisting of two rails with wooden railroad ties (sleepers).[S23 8]

## Signs

In Sprint 23 (week 46) we saw there use to be a Speed Sign[S23 11] which was removed. The description of the early speed sign read _Limits speed for self driving vehicles_ but it was unclear if the "speed" could be adjusted or was different than the 30km/h shown. 

The speed sign was removed between Pre-Alpha and Closed Alpha, though it remained in headers until an unknown patch after Update 3.

## [Storage Container](/wiki/Storage_Container "Storage Container")

In Sprint 6 (week 12) the storage container was first revealed[S6 17] and could be build using 5 Iron Plate. 

The use (storage size) of storage containers in early game development in not known beyond the fact they were available, and had the description of "This stores stuff for you" when selected in the Build Menu.

## [Statues](/wiki/Statues "Statues")

Early game development has the equivalent of Statues in the form of a Trophy. 

In Sprint 20 (week 40) the Trophy could be created on the Workbench (Craft Bench) using the Decor Build Menu.[S20 14] and had the description of _a trophy found while exploring_. It was a representation of the signs of life from another Coffee Stain Studio "project" that was not done after completion of [Goat Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/265930/Goat_Simulator/). 

In Sprint 23 (week 46), the issue with giant items first appeared with a large version of the Trophy.[S23 12]. The "Giant Item Issue" reappeared in Update 4[S23 13][S23 14] that was eventually fixed.

## Trivia

  * [Snutt](/wiki/Coffee_Stain_Studios#Coffee_Stain_Studios "Coffee Stain Studios"), as one of the first things he worked on, was remaking Compass to become what it is now in the game on the top of the HUD.[S23 3] Snutt started playing game in Sprint 26 (week 52) of early game development.[S26 2]
  * [Stefan Hanna](/wiki/Coffee_Stain_Studios#Former_employees "Coffee Stain Studios") did some of the development of fluffy-tail hogs before they became CEO of Coffee Stain Studios.[S23 6]
