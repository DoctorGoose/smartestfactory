## Intro

Hi Pioneers! 

Hello again everyone, Today we have another patch with a pretty sizeable amount of bugfixes and other polish including several crash and bug fixes, multiplayer interaction fixes, many UI, Visual and Audio fixes, and more! 

Given the amount of fixes in this patch, please let us know over at our QA Site if we might have introduced any new issues <https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/> We read your posts every day, so also let us know if there’s anything important that hasn’t been addressed already 

See you all again soon, It’s amazing to see so many of you still enjoying our game every day and it means a lot to all of us <3 

## Bugfixes

  * Potential fix for a rare crash when dismantling a [drone](/wiki/Drone "Drone") at the end of its takeoff sequence

  * Fix for some buildable's disappearing in very [old saves](/wiki/Save_files "Save files") (Around [Update 2](/wiki/Update_2 "Update 2")) 
    * This fix is not retroactive, this means if you have overwritten a save with missing buildings after playing the 1.0 version, those buildings will remain missing.  
This only prevents buildable's disappearing on old saves that are loaded/re-saved from this patch onwards. We’re sorry for the inconvenience, this was a very complicated issue.

  * Fixed [Power Poles](/wiki/Power_Poles "Power Poles") and [Power Tower](/wiki/Power_Tower "Power Tower") not being properly customizable in Multiplayer

  * Fixed Pipeline Pump sounds sometimes still playing after being dismantled
  * Fixed [Railway Block visualization](/wiki/Train_Signals "Train Signals"), it should now work as intended again

    * Finnish - Suomi - 53%
    * Latvian - Latviešu valoda - 59%
    * Norwegian - Norsk - 82%
    * Romanian - Română - 68%
  * Please note that for languages to be reimported into the game, they need to reach at least 50% completion, if you want to help out check out info on our Discord.



## Known issues

There are languages missing

These are the only officially supported languages: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Simplified & Traditional Chinese. 

A lot of translations for Satisfactory have been community driven, which means that every other language previously available (and potential new ones) needs to be translated by the community, before being added as community translations once more. 

A lot of people in the community have already shown interest in helping us out with translations and we are ever so grateful to you all and we'll update translations in game as they come in! If you want to help out check out info on our Discord. Please note that you need to have been part of the server for a time to be eligible for this. 

I Can't Switch supported Languages (workaround available)

If you still have any issue switching between officially supported languages, a quick fix for this is to exit the game, rename the %LOCALAPPDATA%\FactoryGame\Saved\Config folder to %LOCALAPPDATA%\FactoryGame\Saved\Old_Config, then launch the game. 

Plugin Error on launch

This is related to mods installed, Mods have been updated and now work with 1.0 so please make sure to update all your mods!. Keep in mind that not all mods have been updated yet. 

[Crash] Shader Cache (workaround available)

Users may experience the following Fatal Error when booting up the game: 
    
    
    [File\BuildAgent\work\b731a33f2a691e17\UE4\Engine\Source\Runtime\RHI\Private\PipelineStateCache.cpp] [Line: 365] Shader compilation failures are Fatal.
    

This can be fixed by forcing DirectX 11 (dx11) as the rendering API via the launch command: `-dx11`

Video of how to set dx11 as a launch option: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn3e-m4a-hU>

Text information on how to set launch options: [Launch arguments](/wiki/Launch_arguments "Launch arguments")

White static effect over the game (AMD Radeon 5000 Series GPUs, possibly others)

This issue seems to be due to driver issues. Some workarounds on current drivers are: 

  * Try disabling upscaling
  * If you really want to use upscaling, try using something other than FSR
  * If you really want to use FSR, try changing the value of the FSR application by single digit increments towards either the lower or higher end of your current settings
  * Force DirectX 11 as the rendering API through the launch command: `-dx11`



Mouse sensitivity feeling sluggish with V-Sync turned on

We’re currently investigating an issue where some players experience very sluggish mouse movement with V-Sync turned on. In the meantime, we recommend playing with V-Sync turned off if the mouse controls feel overly annoying. 

Players starting at tier 2 on Dedicated Servers

Players are currently starting off at tier 2 upon entering the game on Dedicated Servers, skipping past tier 1. We’re currently looking into limiting the skipped parts of the game on Dedicated Servers to the intro sequence only (tier 0), and possibly even enabling players to experience tier 0 on Dedicated Servers as well.
