**Flying Crab Hatchers** are nest-like objects often found near rivers, cliff edges, [Resource Nodes](/wiki/Resource_Node "Resource Node"), [Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug"), [Artifacts](/wiki/Artifact "Artifact"), and [Crash Sites](/wiki/Crash_Site "Crash Site"). They periodically spawn **Flying Crabs** when aggroed.

## Behavior

When approached by a pioneer for the first time or shot from a distance, the Flying Crab Hatcher will spawn 3 Flying Crabs. Afterwards, it will periodically spawn 1 or 2 Flying Crabs every 5 seconds or each time it is shot, until the Hatcher is destroyed or all pioneers get away from it. Spawned Flying Crabs die when they hit a pioneer or a vehicle, or after 60 seconds. 

Flying Crab aggro sphere radius is 60 Meters. 

When gameplay is set to Passive or Retaliate the hatcher will still spawn Flying Crabs when the [Pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer") is nearby, but the Crabs will not chase the player. 

### Spawning

Flying Crab Hatchers spawn singularly, but there may be several Flying Crab Hatchers in close proximity to each other, and can be prevented from spawning by using [creature respawn prevention methods](/wiki/Creatures#Respawning "Creatures"). 

NOTE: As of 1.0 the hatcher itself does respawn. It is not known whether this is intended or if this is a bug. 

### Combat

[](/wiki/File:Flying_Crab_Hatcher_Spawning_Crabs_U6.png)

[](/wiki/File:Flying_Crab_Hatcher_Spawning_Crabs_U6.png "Enlarge")

An aggroed Hatcher will continue spawning Flying Crabs until it's destroyed.

  * It is possible to stay much closer to a Hatcher by hiding behind foliage ([trees](/wiki/Tree "Tree"), [shrubs](/wiki/Shrub "Shrub"), etc.).
  * Avoid aggroing more than one Hatcher at a time. Either destroy them from a distance with a [](/wiki/Rebar_Gun "Rebar Gun") [Rebar Gun](/wiki/Rebar_Gun "Rebar Gun") or [](/wiki/Rifle "Rifle") [Rifle](/wiki/Rifle "Rifle"), or carefully trigger the Hatchers one by one by approaching them slowly.
  * If a Hatcher is alone and both [](/wiki/Blade_Runners "Blade Runners") [Blade Runners](/wiki/Blade_Runners "Blade Runners") and [](/wiki/Xeno-Basher "Xeno-Basher") [Xeno-Basher](/wiki/Xeno-Basher "Xeno-Basher") are equipped, bunny hopping (sprint, crouch then jump followed by another crouch) to its melee range then quickly bash 3 times will kill it before any Crabs can spawn, due to the spawning action taking around 5 seconds.
  * Pioneers can sneak up on Hatchers: 
    * As long as the Pioneers remain crouched ([`C`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")), the Hatchers won't open no matter how close the Pioneers approach them. They remain closed even when struck by crouched melee attacks.
    * This works anytime the Pioneer is out of a vehicle and holding crouch ([`C`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")), including sliding and jumping and jetpacking. Likely this is a bug.
  * Parking a vehicle over a Hatcher will cause spawned Flying Crabs to die upon touching the vehicle.



## Elite Flying Crab Hatcher

Usually in mid to late game areas an Elite Flying Crab Hatcher may spawn instead, sometime with normal Flying Crab Hatchers. It can be distinguished by the larger size and glowing orange marks on the shell, which are particularly visible at night or in low light areas. 

Behaves identically to the normal Flying Crab Hatcher but spawns 6 Flying Crabs instead of the normal 3 when first awakened, continuously spawns 3 crabs while the [Pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer") is nearby instead of 2, and has more health. 

## Tips

  * As Flying Crabs only have 1 HP, the [](/wiki/Boom_Box "Boom Box") [Boom Box](/wiki/Boom_Box "Boom Box") is an effective weapon against them, as it deals AOE damage.
  * [Gas nobelisks](/wiki/Gas_Nobelisk "Gas Nobelisk") are great at disarming Hatchers as the gas kills any spawned Flying Crabs
  * Even when creature behavior is set to Passive or Retaliate, the Hatcher will still spawn Flying Crabs which will deal damage if a player walks into it; avoid walking too close to Hatchers.
