## Intro

Hi Pioneers! 

Update 5 is now available on Experimental. If you have been following our YouTube videos you’ve seen lots of the new content already, but you can find all of that (and as usual a few exciting surprises) summarized in our Patch Notes video below. And if you want to go straight to the nitty gritty details, we have the full list of detailed patch notes further down as well! 

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfaReoks6OM>

With this Update we have worked on many of the base systems in Satisfactory to improve the game. It’s all ready for you to play with, but we are just starting the Experimental period for this release, and we appreciate all the feedback you can give us. If you have thoughts on these new features or find any bugs, feel free to visit our Q&A site and let us know what you think! The site can be found here: <https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/>

Let's go ahead and dig into the new content available to you now. We can’t wait to see what you all will create with this! 

### [Signs](/wiki/Signs "Signs")

Better late than never but we’re finally adding Signs to the game! Signs come in various sizes, and you can customize them using a selection of layouts, icons, display text, and backgrounds depending on the Sign. 

Signs can be placed by themselves on a height adjustable pole, or they can be snapped to [Storage Containers](/wiki/Storage_Container "Storage Container"), [Walls](/wiki/Walls "Walls"), and even each other to create highly customized displays. 

### Customizer

Are you tired of using the overly simplistic [Color Gun](/wiki/Color_Gun "Color Gun")? Are you finding the process of setting the color for every single [foundation](/wiki/Foundation "Foundation") or wall piece tedious? Wish there were more cosmetic options for foundations, walls and [roofs](/wiki/Roofs "Roofs")? 

Introducing the [Customizer](/wiki/Customizer "Customizer"), a new way of adjusting your Walls, Foundations, and Roofs! After it is unlocked with the [AWESOME Shop](/wiki/AWESOME_Shop "AWESOME Shop") in [Tier 2](/wiki/Tier_2 "Tier 2") you can find it as a new tab in the Build Menu. It replaces the [Color Guns](/wiki/Color_Gun "Color Gun") coloring ability and any Wall, Foundation, and Roof materials as well as Foundation patterns can be found here after you unlock them in the AWESOME Shop. 

#### Materials

We’ve added new Materials for [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations") and [Walls](/wiki/Walls "Walls"), and the newly added [Roofs](/wiki/Roofs "Roofs") come with several Materials as well. While we had FICSIT and Steel Walls before, this changes how these buildings are unlocked and used. For example, new shapes of Foundations are still unlocked in the AWESOME Shop, and initially they only come in the standard FICSIT Material. But unlocking a new Material for Foundations, which you also do in the AWESOME Shop, will allow you to apply that Material to any of the Foundations you have available. 

Once you’ve unlocked a new Material you just select it in the [Customizer](/wiki/Customizer "Customizer"), click or hold and just paint away! Any material you select will only be applied to structures that are relevant. It’s a safe and easy way to quickly change the look of your existing factories. 

You can also place build pieces with the material you want from the get-go. Simply select the material type you would like the buildable to have and build away! You can even bind the material type to your [hotbar](/wiki/Hotbar "Hotbar") if you’re on the go. 

#### Colors

Colors are now right there in the customizer too, since it fully replaces the Color Gun. This means painting your factory also benefits from hold to paint addition, which will make coloring faster than ever! 

You can find all the standard FICSIT colors in there and create your own Swatches and save them. After that you can either select them from the Customizer or bind them to your hotbar. 

#### Patterns

Arrows, lines, symbols and many more Patterns can now be painted onto [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations") with the [Customizer](/wiki/Customizer "Customizer")! There is a total of 58 Patterns that can be unlocked in the [AWESOME Shop](/wiki/AWESOME_Shop "AWESOME Shop") which will help you create clearer layouts for your factory floors. 

### Build system changes

Satisfactory’s build systems have received a major overhaul to make building factories and production setup faster and cleaner. These systems are a large part of Satisfactory and are applied to lots of different building interactions, so it can be difficult to have them perfect at Experimental launch. We’re confident they will be very helpful in their current state but let us know if you have any feedback on our Q&A site! 

#### Soft and Hard [Clearance](/wiki/Build_Clearance "Build Clearance")

Previously (almost) all buildings had a building clearance that prevented you from building them into each other. We changed that now with the introduction of Soft and Hard Clearance! 

Buildings with Hard Clearance are all buildings that have functionality such as [Constructors](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor"), [Assemblers](/wiki/Assembler "Assembler"), [Power Poles](/wiki/Power_Poles "Power Poles"), [Splitter](/wiki/Splitter "Splitter"), [The HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB"), etc. They will function largely as before and cannot be built overlapping with each other. 

Buildings with Soft Clearance are cosmetic and structural buildables as well as [Conveyor Belts](/wiki/Conveyor_Belts "Conveyor Belts") and [Pipes](/wiki/Pipe "Pipe"), and they can now be built overlapping with any other buildings to give you more freedom when designing and building your factories, either for cosmetic purposes or to make even more compact factory floors. 

Whether your build pieces clip through each other or not is entirely up to you and if this is something that bothers you, you will still be notified by the game when Soft Clearance clipping occurs via an on-screen build warning and a new hologram color signalling those buildings are overlapping. 

#### Quick Switching

Another addition to the Build System is that we’ve improved the Quick Switching system when constructing buildings. 

Previously, when holding [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") while in the build mode, a radial menu would open and allow you to select other buildings of the same type as the building you were constructing. Now you can simply tap [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to cycle through those selections quickly and swap between things such as different Foundation height, Conveyor Belt speed or machine types. 

#### [Zooping](/wiki/Build_Gun#Zoop "Build Gun")

If you are tired of building one foundation block at a time, I know I am, you can just switch build modes and zooooop! This will make building much faster as you’re now able to place up to 10 build pieces at a time. 

Zooping can be used for [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations"), [Walls](/wiki/Walls "Walls") and most of the cosmetic build pieces by just dragging them horizontally or vertically, but it isn’t available for any buildings such as manufacturers and power generators. 

### New cosmetic build pieces

We love what you all have done with your factories with what little you had but what if you had more? Well in Update 5 we’ve added new cosmetic buildings pieces and reworked existing ones: [Beams](/wiki/Beams "Beams"), new Walls & [Windows]], more [Pillars](/wiki/Pillars "Pillars") & [Frames](/wiki/Frames "Frames"), the list goes on for a bit and you can find it in full in the detailed patch notes below. 

We’ve also added new walkways and walkway stairs and one of the most requested features, Ramp Railings. All of this, in combination with the build system improvements, will significantly change what your factories can look like. 

### [Trains](/wiki/Train "Train")

#### Signalling system

Ever since we introduced trains to the game back in the day, we’ve been wanting to add a Signalling System and we’re finally doing it! There now are two types of Train Signals: [Block Signals](/wiki/Block_Signal "Block Signal") and [Path Signals](/wiki/Path_Signal "Path Signal"). While a single Train on its own [Track](/wiki/Track "Track") will continue to function just fine, shared Track setups will require the use of Signals to function. 

Block Signals can be placed along the train tracks to create sections of a track that only one Train can occupy at a time. They are excellent at preventing your Trains from crashing into each other, but do not take different paths going through the same block into account, which can result in a deadlock between Trains coming from different directions. 

Path Signals are used to reserve a path through one or more blocks so you can create safe, collision free, multi-directional intersections. Tracks that are reserved via path signals will only free up again once the Train that they were reserved for has passed through. 

#### Collision

If you don’t make use of the signals your trains will now collide with each other and derail spectacularly depending on their speed! Fixing up the aftermath of a collision is easy; you just walk up to any part of a derailed Train and press [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). Keep in mind that you will still have to add Signals or adjust how you built the Track in order to prevent future collisions! 

#### Timetables

There’s also been an update to how the Timetables work. You can now create some basic logic for what your Train should do when it stops at any given station, so you might have a Train only stop for a limited time or wait until it’s fully loaded, and you can also control what resources it should load or unload. This will open many options for customizing Train routes further. 

### [Vehicles](/wiki/Vehicles "Vehicles")

#### Automation system changes

There’s been a huge update to automated vehicle pathing and the systems surrounding it. 

Previously, automated vehicles would drive blindly at their next waypoint without considering where they would be going next. Now vehicles will take upcoming waypoints into consideration when driving, making their pathing much more reliable. 

We’ve also introduced a basic obstacle avoidance system to handle cases where vehicles might run into something in their path, vehicles won’t completely recalculate their route, but they will do their best to get going again. 

And in the cases where vehicles do get completely stuck then as a last resort, vehicle ghosting will make sure that vehicles stay on track. 

#### Vehicle paths

We’ve added the ability to save and load recorded vehicle paths between Vehicles of the same type. That means if you save a route for example in a Tractor, you will be able to load that route into another Tractor to scale up throughput without re-recording that whole route. 

Another change is that a route now needs to be a closed loop, so it starts and ends at the same point. To make that clearer we changed the first node in a path to be easily recognizable. 

#### [Truck Stations](/wiki/Truck_Station "Truck Station")

Truck Stations now have a new model and another Input and Output slot so the throughput has doubled. Also [fuel](/wiki/Fuels "Fuels") consumption in Truck Stations is now a lot smarter as Vehicles will only take the amount of fuel needed to complete a full loop. 

We’ve updated the UI for Truck Stations with additional information such as average fuel consumption and delivery throughput to make integrating them into your factories easier. 

And by the way, you can paint vehicles now! Even the [Factory Cart](/wiki/Factory_Cart "Factory Cart")! 

### [Map](/wiki/Map "Map") updates

#### [Northern Forest](/wiki/Northern_Forest "Northern Forest")

This area gotten a major facelift in Update 5. There have been some reworks regarding lighting and fog, very minor changes in the landscape, but the foliage has changed significantly. If you’ve built something in Northern Forest expect some [trees](/wiki/Tree "Tree") and bushes stick up in your factories, but that’s nothing your trusty old [Chainsaw](/wiki/Chainsaw "Chainsaw") or some [Nobelisks](/wiki/Nobelisk "Nobelisk") can’t fix. 

#### [Dune Desert](/wiki/Dune_Desert "Dune Desert")

Four new landmarks have been added, the northern cliff wall has gotten a lot of love and some additional smaller set dressing has been done. No major changes that should impact your factories, but some sweet improvements to this area. 

We haven’t made any changes to the [Resource Nodes](/wiki/Resource_Node "Resource Node") there so they will all still be in the same place. 

#### [Caves](/wiki/Cave "Cave")

You’re also going to see a change to some of the caves in the game, which have a much richer and more mystical vibe to them now. Only a few caves have changed in Update 5, but the goal is to give this kind of treatment to more caves in the game moving forward. 

### New factory [music](/wiki/Music "Music")

We’ve added some new music for the factory playlist as well. There is a total of 5 new intermission and 3 new full-length tracks. They’re great additions to the soundscape of Satisfactory, so keep your ears peeled while trying out all the new building options and let us know what you think! 

### [Dedicated servers](/wiki/Dedicated_servers "Dedicated servers")

We’re finally releasing an Experimental version of Dedicated Server support! And when we say Experimental, we mean EXPERIMENTAL. While we have been able to run them successfully and fix a lot of bugs, we expect more issues to appear as you all start using Dedicated Servers. You can help us getting the Dedicated Servers more stable by trying them out and sending us your feedback. 

You can find information on Dedicated Servers and setting them up on the wiki: [Dedicated Servers](/wiki/Dedicated_Servers "Dedicated Servers")

  * You can now lock your FPS to a specific number in the Options menu
  * You can now manually and individually adjust the volume of every Factory Building and player Equipment to your liking
  * While in Mass [Dismantle](/wiki/Build_Gun "Build Gun") mode, holding ‘Mouse Button 4’ (side button) will only keep either the most common, or the first, building type selected for dismantle

  * You can now hold [`Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") when hovering over [wall](/wiki/Wall "Wall") with a different buildable of the same category to replace it instead of snap to it (i.E. Aiming at a Wall while having a [Window](/wiki/Window "Window") out will usually snap to it, but holding CTRL will place it in the same spot as the wall instead)
  * [Conveyor Lifts](/wiki/Conveyor_Lift "Conveyor Lift") now have an alternate build mode titled Reversed which reverses the direction of the belt for the Input/Output
  * You can now de-select buildings you’ve selected with Mass Dismantling by aiming at the specific building and tapping [`Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")

  * Fixed Clearance boxes getting stuck when exiting the Build Gun after having used Quick Switch
  * Fixed up storage boxes in vehicles not being interactable sometimes
  * Fixed a bunch of text and localization-related bugs
