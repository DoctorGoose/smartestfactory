### Steam Deck

_Main article:_[ Controller > Steam Deck](/wiki/Controller#Steam_Deck "Controller")

While possible to play game on a Steam Deck, the game is currently **not verified for Steam Deck**.[9] The game currently has 4 out of 5 things needed to be verified on Steam Deck, and [Coffee Stain Studios](/wiki/Coffee_Stain_Studios "Coffee Stain Studios") is working on getting all 5 done soon which will include resolving the issue of certain UI text being too small.

### Nintendo Switch

There are no current plans for a Nintendo Switch release.[10]

## Game content

Consoles will feature Update 1.1 content.[11] Game updates are thereafter planned to be released simultaneously with PC and console.[12] The scale[13] or cadence[14] of updates shouldn't be affected due to having to support multiple platforms. 

### Experimental version

Only PC players will be able to use the Experimental version of the game.[15]

## Crossplay and interoperability

### Console to console crossplay

Crossplay between PlayStation and Xbox consoles will be available. 

### PC to console crossplay

There will be no crossplay between PC and console at release _(but may be enabled at a later date).[16]_

  * The primary reason for this is that PC players have the freedom to modify the game by adjusting settings using config files, and using [mods and save editors](/wiki/Online_tools "Online tools"), which destabilizes the game. The console release focuses on a stable experience.
  * The possibility of implementing PC to console crossplay hasn't been ruled out entirely, but it would take "all hands on deck for a really long time".[17]



### Dedicated Server

The ability to use [Dedicated servers](/wiki/Dedicated_servers "Dedicated servers") will not be available on the console release.[18]

## Features

### Performance presets

Console release will include some performance presets:[19]

  * **Quality:** Will increase visual fidelity but lock your performance to 30 FPS.
  * **Performance:** Will decrease range on some sliders, but you can get 60 FPS.
  * **Balance:** Decreases quality a bit but you can get 40 FPS.



The PS5 Pro will display the [PS5 Pro Enhanced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:PlayStation_5_Pro_enhanced_games "wikipedia:Category:PlayStation 5 Pro enhanced games") visual tag, which will mean for the [Satisfactory](/wiki/Satisfactory "Satisfactory") game it will have some additional visual enhancements like improved draw distance, enhanced volumetric's, and more.[20]

### Couch co-op play

There will be no couch co-op play primarily due to the amount of "core systems" are used for a single view experience. These "core systems" have been heavily optimized for single viewport in mind. If you added another viewport you would have to start from scratch. Also there are UI issues if you had to design game with split-screen ability.[21]

### Save Files

You will not be able to share save files from Xbox to Playstation _(or vice-versa)_ , or desktop version to console _(or vice-versa)_.[22][23][24]. 

  * You can't share between consoles of a different type because these consoles run on different operating systems, so the save files are not compatible with each other. The save data is often encrypted and tied to the specific platform's account to prevent data from being easily moved or copied. You _might_ be able to transfer files from Xbox One to Xbox Series X/S, or from Playstation 4 to Playstation 5, if allowed.
  * You won't be able to share between desktop version to a console _(or vice-versa)_ initially upon launch of game release to console, however the ability to share [PC version save files](/wiki/Save_files "Save files") hasn't been ruled out entirely and [Coffee Stain Studios](/wiki/Coffee_Stain_Studios "Coffee Stain Studios") developers are exploring if there is a way that can be done gracefully, and doesn't violate any Xbox or Playstation Terms of Service (TOS). Consoles have a max size for save files which are saved in a "slot system" which limits the amount of data that could be shared _(if even possible)._



### Keyboard and mouse

It will not be possible to use the [keyboard and mouse](/wiki/Controls "Controls") on launch, but the feature is being worked on for the future.[25] Both Sony and Microsoft needs to approve the Keyboard / Mouse Feature first before it can be added.
