The **Conveyor Splitter** is a logistic structure that takes items from a single input [Conveyor Belt](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt "Conveyor Belt") or [Lift](/wiki/Conveyor_Lift "Conveyor Lift") and outputs them between up to three other belts or lifts.

## Construction

The [](/wiki/Conveyor_Splitter "Conveyor Splitter") Conveyor Splitter and [](/wiki/Conveyor_Merger "Conveyor Merger") [Conveyor Merger](/wiki/Conveyor_Merger "Conveyor Merger") have fairly large collision boxes which are likely to obstruct additional parallel belts. For example, a splitter for [](/wiki/Screw "Screw") [Screw](/wiki/Screw "Screw") belt is likely to block the construction of [](/wiki/Iron_Plate "Iron Plate") [Iron Plate](/wiki/Iron_Plate "Iron Plate") belt. It is advised to build other nearby belts before building the splitter/merger. 

### Stacking

You can stack the splitters and/or mergers on top of each other, each stacking offset by 2-meter height. 

Splitters can be built directly onto straight sections of existing [](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt "Conveyor Belt") [Conveyor Belt](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt "Conveyor Belt"), even if the belt is elevated or sloped. This makes it easy to split items off of raised or stacked belts without first having to stack splitters up to the correct height. When placing splitters on an existing belt, they do not snap to the foundation grid, even if the belt is on the ground level. 

Splitters and Mergers **cannot** be built directly onto a [building](/wiki/Building "Building")'s belt connector (so attempting to extract items out of an [overclocked](/wiki/Overclock "Overclock") [Miner](/wiki/Miner "Miner") faster than the speed of a [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt") is not possible. You can snap Splitters and Mergers onto either end of a [Conveyor Lift](/wiki/Conveyor_Lift "Conveyor Lift"). 

### Upgrading and changing

  * Splitters can be upgraded to [Smart](/wiki/Smart_Splitter "Smart Splitter") or [Programmable](/wiki/Programmable_Splitter "Programmable Splitter") versions by holding **Snap To Guidelines/Snap Mode** ( [`Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") by default) while aiming any Splitter variant hologram at any other already-built Splitter variant.
  * Splitters can also be changed to a [Merger](/wiki/Merger "Merger") as long as **only the main input is connected.**



### Conveyor splitting styles

  * [Manifold](/wiki/Manifold "Manifold")
  * [Balancer](/wiki/Balancer "Balancer")



## Usage

A Conveyor Splitter can be easily distinguished from a Conveyor Merger, as it has a **single input** that is labelled ≡ and is orange-colored at the top _(unless[customized to use a different color](/wiki/Customizer "Customizer"))_, and has **three outputs** that are labelled with a 〕 arrow and are silver-colored at the top. 

A splitter splits items from one input conveyor into one, two or three connected output conveyor(s), the input side must be connected to a belt for it to function. If one output conveyor is backed up, the splitter will attempt to split the items among the remaining output belts, if all output conveyors are backed up, the splitter will stop splitting and build up its buffer of nine items before finally stopping the intake from the input conveyor. 

All types of splitters operate at a rate of 2 000/min, but the fastest conveyor operates at 1200/min. 

[](/wiki/File:Splitter_mechanism.png)

## Types

There are three types of splitters available, each with different sorting capabilities. 

### Basic

The standard splitter plainly splits items between its outputs in sequence. If any output is full, it will distribute the incoming items into the remaining outputs evenly. 

### Smart

_Main article:_[Smart Splitter](/wiki/Smart_Splitter "Smart Splitter")

Each output can have a filter set to either "None", "Any" "Any Undefined", "Overflow" or one specific item type. 

### Programmable

_Main article:_[Programmable Splitter](/wiki/Programmable_Splitter "Programmable Splitter")

Functions just like a Smart Splitter, but multiple filters (items) can be set for each output. 

### Vertical

_Main article:_[Conveyor Lifts](/wiki/Conveyor_Lifts "Conveyor Lifts")

[Version 1.1](/wiki/Patch_1.1.0.0 "Patch 1.1.0.0") added ability to place [Splitters](/wiki/Splitter "Splitter") _(which become**Vertical Splitters**)_ on Conveyor Lifts allowing more modularity to your vertical builds. 

## Trivia

  * It is easy to differentiate between the input and output slot by looking at the shape of the LED light at the belt connector. Its outputs are labelled **〕** arrow and the input is labelled **≡** as 3 smaller dots. From the plan view, the input is always colored (default orange) while the outputs are always silver-colored.
  * Splitters will only split across the number of outputs you use. So you can divide the input into two halves, or three thirds. This is a useful characteristic to apply efficient early game set-ups, e.g. smelting ores, which are predominantly simple ratios of one to two, one to four or one to eight.
  * Plan ahead, get into a habit of adding a Conveyor Splitter before every input of production buildings. This allows you to expand a line of production buildings (a.k.a [Manifold](/wiki/Manifold "Manifold")) later on.



## Current issues

  * The splitters and mergers have a buffer of nine items that can be stored inside them, first-in, last-out. This can be an issue when accidentally sent a belt of wrong items into it and trying to purge the wrong items afterward. It is recommended to rebuild the splitters and the belts altogether.
  * If a splitter is built onto an existing belt, it can sometimes retain a short segment of the belt within it. When upgrading the belt, later on, a short segment of the belt can be left forgotten which can cause a throughput issue. Dismantle the splitter to avoid this. If the splitter is built before connecting the belts, then it is fine.
  * When loading a save, splitters can duplicate an item that was inside when the game was saved. This can lead to issues in setups that rely on exact amount of items on belts.
