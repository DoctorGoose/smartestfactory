This template is added at the top of image pages to mark images that need improved versions, such as a file that was uploaded only a placeholder or is of poor quality. 

Don't be afraid to remove these notices after uploading the file. Leaving these notices behind after addressing the problem is confusing to other wiki users. 

Any pages using this template will be automatically placed in the [Images needing improvement](/wiki/Category:Images_needing_improvement "Category:Images needing improvement") category.
