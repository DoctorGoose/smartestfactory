Using `{{[Hatnote](/wiki/Template:Hatnote "Template:Hatnote")}}` formats text into the standard stylistic for a wiki hatnote. That produces a short note placed at the top of an article to provide disambiguation of closely related terms or summarise a topic, explaining its boundaries. 

## Function

This template is primarily used to add a correctly formatted _hatnote_ to a page. Often, but not always, this is a _disambiguation link_ at the top of article pages. It places an HTML `div-` / `div` block around the text entered as its only argument, which provides standardized formatting (contents are indented and italicized in most displays); it also isolates the contained code to make sure that it is interpreted correctly. 

This template is also used as the "meta-template" for additional specialized disambiguation link templates. 

The template does not automatically create links of any kind. Links and other desired formatting must be explicitly added, using normal wiki markup. 

This is the documentation page, it should be transcluded into the main template page. See [Template:Doc](/wiki/Template:Doc "Template:Doc") for more information.
