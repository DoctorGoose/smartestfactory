## Hotfix

Several hours after the initial patch, a hotfix was released. Only a single line was added to the bottom of the patch notes: 

  * HOTFIX: Fixed a crash that could occur when feeding too many high level items into the [AWESOME Sink](/wiki/AWESOME_Sink "AWESOME Sink") too quickly.



The build number changed to 114228, while the version number remained the same. 

## Intro

Hi Pioneers! 

Here it is, the long sought-after Update 3 out on Experimental! Before I tell you anything about it, you might want to check out the trailer we made for it. Or just jump straight into the patch notes, do whatever makes you happy! Also, a reminder that all your existing factories will have to be majorly refactored in this version of the game, due to the amount of changes we have made.

And now, let’s take a look at what we’ve got for you. We’ve joked a lot about Pipes ever since people started requesting them, but now they are finally in the game! And the changes they introduce to Satisfactory are significant. You can find all the details in the patch notes, it’s a whole lot of resources, building changes, building additions, and more. 

We’ve also added a way for you to sink your excess resources and get something in return via the A.W.E.S.O.M.E. Sink & Store, which we both teased already in the videos leading up to this release. 

A brand-new travel method has been added as well: Hypertubes. With them you can build traveling routes for your Pioneer through the factory and game world. 

Another large change that we already revealed is the rework of the Dune Desert into a new starting area. This is a bit of an experiment, since we designed it for more experienced players, so let us know what you think! 

Apart from the new content, the entire game received a rebalance to address issues we’ve been collecting over time. And we did a whole lot of fixes and tweaks to the game in general, some work under the hood and many adjustments that should be visible improvements. There is too much for me to go into detail here, so check out the patch notes for more details. 

Due to the sheer amount of changes and new features, it’s possible that you will find quite a few new issues. We are fully focused on fixing this version up, so make sure to report everything you find to us through our questions site and help us get it ready for Early Access. And speaking of the questions site: We have a new one out now! It is currently in a beta phase and we will update and improve it as we go. With the new site we want to improve communication between us and the community on all the bugs and suggestions that are being posted there. The old site is still available as an archive so all information on there is saved. 

Here is the link to the site: <https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/>

We’ve been working on this update for a while and we are incredibly excited for you to play it! Hope you all will enjoy what we’ve made for you :heart:

  * Memory optimisations

  * When aiming at the workbench, now the workbench is outlined, and not the entire vehicle

## Networking

  * You can now skip the drop pod scene and onboarding from the main menu.
  * You can press R while in build mode to toggle between different build styles when building Pipes.
