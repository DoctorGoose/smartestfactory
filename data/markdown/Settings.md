    * Fix head bobbing not working, and head bobbing scale option not affecting anything
    * Fixed so players don't get registered as an "aggressor" when dealing damage to a creature in passive mode. (Creature won’t immediately attack when changing from passive to retaliate)

  * [Patch 0.8.0.5](/wiki/Patch_0.8.0.5 "Patch 0.8.0.5")
    * Removed the legacy option for “Enable Gamepad Input” from the “Controls” submenu and removed leftover keybinds 
      * To elaborate further on this change, This option did NOT mean that we had gamepad support, this has never been the case, it was some legacy leftover inputs from default UE4, we intentionally left those in as at the time, some players were using them alongside the custom controller configs on Steam to create controller layouts for the game. 
        * In UE5, this option does nothing as a result of the Input System overhaul, there also were some leftover keybindings, I.E. Right Thumbstick look, which was not properly set up and would cause issues, so this would actually get in the way of anyone who is trying to properly set up a controller config via Steam or any other third party application.
        * Now these leftover inputs have been removed, so now you should be able to properly set up a custom controller configuration without any issues.
        * Existing custom controller configs will most likely need to be updated when moving from Update 7 to Update 8, but this was already the case, now it will just be smoother when trying to update these configs as there will be no leftover inputs that get in the way.
  * [Patch 0.8.0.4](/wiki/Patch_0.8.0.4 "Patch 0.8.0.4")
    * Fixed the “Enable Advanced Game Settings” checkbox still showing up on the Loading Menu even if the save already had Advanced Game Settings enabled

    * Fixed the Max FPS option not allowing to set a custom value from the number properly and always displaying 0
  * [Patch 0.8.0.1](/wiki/Patch_0.8.0.1 "Patch 0.8.0.1")
    * Removed "Cinematic" Global Illumination preset due to the fact that VRAM does not get flushed correctly, which would lead to severe performance loss until the game is restarted.
    * Renamed TSR "Insanity" Preset to "No downscaling" and added Tooltips clarifying their purpose 
      * Performance (Performance over quality, Some rendering artifacts)
      * Balanced (Performance and quality focused)
      * Quality (Quality Focused)
      * No Downscaling (Only Anti aliasing, not recommended!)

      * `-DX12`
  * [Patch 0.5.0.10](/wiki/Patch_0.5.0.10 "Patch 0.5.0.10")
    * Made DX12 the [default graphics renderer](/wiki/Unreal_Engine "Unreal Engine"). When not supported the game should still default to DX11. Options Menu might show DX12 as selected even though DX11 is the one active in these cases. (Known Bug)
    * Fixed Options Menu not scrolling down all the way in certain menus
  * [Patch 0.5.0.9](/wiki/Patch_0.5.0.9 "Patch 0.5.0.9")
  * Added "Misophonia Mode" under Audio Options, this will replace "munching" sounds with sounds not generated or connected to human interactions
  * Added a volume slider for "Manual Mining" under Audio > Equipment Volume
  * Quite significantly increased Gameplay > Network Quality scalability options. This should help with excessive load times on larger saves and for players who have never modified their network settings.
  * [Patch 0.5.0.8](/wiki/Patch_0.5.0.8 "Patch 0.5.0.8"): Added a “Consumables Volume” Sub Option and [Medicinal Inhaler](/wiki/Medicinal_Inhaler "Medicinal Inhaler") volume control has now been added under “Equipment Volume”

    * You can now manually and individually adjust the volume of every Factory Building and player Equipment to your liking
    * Added an option to disable Mouse Smoothing in the Options menu
    * You can now individually change the colors for all holograms in the Options menu. (Hologram, Dismantle, Hard Clearance, Soft Clearance)[7]
    * DX12 now available again as experimental renderer in the options menu
    * Vulkan now available again as experimental renderer in the options menu
