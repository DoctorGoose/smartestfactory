The **Space Elevator** is a special building used to complete phases of Project Assembly by supplying it with [Project Assembly Parts](/wiki/Category:Project_Assembly_parts "Category:Project Assembly parts"). The first three deliveries unlock two higher Tiers of [Milestones](/wiki/Milestones "Milestones"), while the fourth one unlocks the 9th and final Tier and the fifth delivery launches Project Assembly and unlocks the ['Employee of the Planet' Cup](/wiki/%27Employee_of_the_Planet%27_Cup "'Employee of the Planet' Cup") in the [AWESOME Shop](/wiki/AWESOME_Shop "AWESOME Shop"). 

It is visible from all parts of the [world](/wiki/World "World"), making it a useful landmark for navigation.

## Usage

The Space Elevator must be constructed to unlock [Tier 3 and above](/wiki/Milestones#Tier_3 "Milestones"). Only one Space Elevator at a time can be placed in a world. 

### Dismantling and relocating

The Space Elevator can be dismantled and relocated without losing progress at any time. When relocated, after the Space Elevator is rebuilt, the Project Assembly platform will move from its former location to align itself with the Space Elevator's new position.[1]

### Project Assembly

Project Assembly Parts can be manually supplied from the inventory [`Tab ↹`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), or with connected conveyors. Once an item has been loaded into the elevator, it cannot be retrieved manually, although dismantling the Space Elevator with the [Build Gun](/wiki/Build_Gun "Build Gun") will return all loaded items. 

Once the required items are fully satisfied, use the mouse and drag the handle down, 2 times (Load → Seal → Send). When sent, an animation will play where the cargo platform will be ejected up into space, gliding along the central rail. After a while, it will come back down and dock in its default position. 

If the package is sealed, but not sent, and the UI is closed, the handle will have to be re-pulled again (Load → Seal). 

In a multiplayer game, the Space Elevator and its progress is shared among all players. The handle in the UI doesn't sync between players. 

### Cloudy day animation

**Expand to reveal spoiler**

If a Space Elevator Project Assembly parts are sent while there are lots of clouds overhead a special animation is played. 

See this example video.[2]

### Project Assembly launch (ending)

**Expand to reveal spoiler**

Completing Phase 5 of Project Assembly initiates the ending, where a specific sequence of tasks must be performed through the Space Elevator display. When complete, Project Assembly can be launched by pulling a lever one final time, playing a special animation from the Space Elevator. 

The elevator assembles a huge ship, which flies off and [blasts](/wiki/Ballistic_Warp_Drive "Ballistic Warp Drive") open a wormhole before flying through it. Upon completion of this sequence, ADA will speak again, congratulating the player as the credits begin. From this point on, the elevator repositions itself to form the [FICSIT](/wiki/FICSIT "FICSIT") Logo, and the console will permanently display the message "Project Assembly Launched. Pioneer purpose concluded." 

See this example video[3] _(13 minutes)._

### Total number of parts needed

Most project parts from later phases also need project parts from earlier phases, e.g. the [](/wiki/Modular_Engine "Modular Engine") [Modular Engine](/wiki/Modular_Engine "Modular Engine") is needed 500 times in Phase 3 and 625 times in Phase 4 (for crafting 250 [](/wiki/Thermal_Propulsion_Rocket "Thermal Propulsion Rocket") [Thermal Propulsion Rockets](/wiki/Thermal_Propulsion_Rocket "Thermal Propulsion Rocket")). This means that the total number of parts needed in every phase is higher than the initial phase requirements for that part (e.g. 1,625 [](/wiki/Modular_Engine "Modular Engine") [Modular Engine](/wiki/Modular_Engine "Modular Engine") in total vs. just the 500 for completing Phase 3). 

Project Part | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Phase 4 | Phase 5 | Total

## Tips

  * Although it has two terminals in its model, the player can interact [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") with the Space Elevator from any angle.
  * If you are placing a Space Elevator on a foundation platform, you can get centering guidelines by placing observation towers at two cardinal, non-aligned compass points (N/E, N/W, S/E, or S/W, but not N/S or E/W) on your platform, then stand on one of the towers, you will get alignment guidelines to place the center of the elevator in the center of the platform.
  * An easier alternative is to find the center of the platform, look directly down, place a hologram under your feet, lock it with [`H`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), move away, confirm that the elevator is facing the right way and build it.
  * Due to the high cost of project parts, early-stage pioneers might want to prevent overproducing them, in order to save up on parts that are harder to manufacture. Later on, the project parts can be a good source of [AWESOME Sink](/wiki/AWESOME_Sink "AWESOME Sink") points. 
    * Many early parts are used to craft later parts, so extras can usually be saved to speed up production later on.
  * Strategic use of [Somersloops](/wiki/Somersloop "Somersloop") can be used to ease Project Part production - by amplifying the machine making each stage of Project Part, one Ballistic Warp Drive will only cost 1.25 Smart Plates, instead of the usual 5.
  * In multiplayer, all pioneers currently online will also receive the relevant achievement for a phase being completed, so it is possible for multiple pioneers to get every achievement related to Project Assembly in a single shared save. However, pioneers who are offline when a phase is completed will not receive these achievements upon logging back in.

## Narrative

**Expand to reveal spoiler**

While completing initial build of the Space Elevator, plus the start and completion of each of the 5 phases, the player will hear [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA") speak. 

  * View [Story Project Assembly](/wiki/Story#Project_Assembly "Story") to read and hear individual ADA messages.
  * View [Story Ending Sequence](/wiki/Story#Ending_Sequence "Story") to read and hear ADA message.



## Trivia

  * After each delivery, the Space Elevator will ascend to the sky for a few minutes then descend back to the lower level.
  * Only the anchors of the Space Elevator are constructed by the pioneer, which explains its rather cheap price. When built, the anchor grabs the shaft, which is dropped from space.
  * The delivery mechanism of the Space Elevator does have collision maps, so if the player managed to work their way up to the top, they would be able to walk around on it. However, this collision area is very inaccurate, meaning that you won't be walking directly on the platform.
  * The Project Assembly Station can be seen in game, above the Space Elevator, and visually builds new components with each delivery.[4]
  * The elevator's shaft texture is very low-quality above the platform. Below the platform, the shaft has a much higher-quality texture. This part of the elevator has blinking lights that flash in an upward-traveling pattern.
  * It is possible to complete the last phase within 30 hours. In speedrun community, it is often referred as 'Npackage% speedrun' where N can be 1, 2, 3 or 4, and '1' is omitted for the first phase.
  * The internal name of the Space Elevator is "Spelevator".[5]
  * An early concept had considered using the Space Elevator for [sinking items](/wiki/AWESOME_Sink "AWESOME Sink"), but this was discarded due to concerns about getting all the resources to one central location.[6]
  * Despite having 6 conveyor inputs, none of the phases require more than 4 different inputs. No other building in the game has such redundant inputs that no recipe would fully utilize.
  * The height of the space elevator cable is 55km. The project assembly is approximately 24km in diameter and altitude at the top is 33km.



### Food Court

  * According to [Jace](/wiki/Jace "Jace"), [Sofi](/wiki/Sofi "Sofi"), and [Snutt](/wiki/Snutt "Snutt"), there is supposedly a food court at the top of the Space Elevator.[7][8]
    * According to [Snutt](/wiki/Snutt "Snutt"), Project Assembly both _is_ a Food Court and _has_ a Food Court.[9]



#### Menu

  * If the planet's [flora](/wiki/Category:Flora "Category:Flora") & [fauna](/wiki/Category:Fauna "Category:Fauna") are to be used in preparing food to be served in the food court, it is possible that the digestive tracts of the native species are either non-existent or toxic to the intended diners as the FICSIT catering department will likely need to order synthetic sausage casings.[10]
  * [Lizard Doggo](/wiki/Lizard_Doggo "Lizard Doggo") burgers, tacos, kebabs, stir-fry, and gyoza will be on the menu.[11]
    * The [Lizard Doggo](/wiki/Lizard_Doggo "Lizard Doggo") burger will cost [1 coupon](/wiki/FICSIT_Coupon "FICSIT Coupon").[12]
    * Vegetarian options have been considered but not confirmed.[13]
  * [Hog](/wiki/Fluffy-tailed_Hog "Fluffy-tailed Hog") steak will be a special on the menu.[14]
