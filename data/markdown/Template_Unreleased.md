The "Unreleased" template is used for content which is available only in the Experimental branch, has been removed from the game, is unconfirmed (typically acquired by looking for details in gameplay footage or gathering tidbits of developer commentary), is upcoming (e.g. was officially teased or announced) or is otherwise unspecified unreleased content (especially that found by data-mining the game content or by the use of save editing). 

This template will put the page into a category based on the parameter, in order [Category:Unreleased content](/wiki/Category:Unreleased_content "Category:Unreleased content"), [Category:Stable-only content](/wiki/Category:Stable-only_content "Category:Stable-only content"), [Category:Experimental content](/wiki/Category:Experimental_content "Category:Experimental content"), [Category:Removed content](/wiki/Category:Removed_content "Category:Removed content") or [Category:Unconfirmed features](/wiki/Category:Unconfirmed_features "Category:Unconfirmed features").
