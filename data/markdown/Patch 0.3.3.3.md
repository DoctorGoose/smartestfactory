## Intro

Hi Pioneers! 

It is finally time, Update 3 is on Early Access! With it come pipes, fluid resources, the AWESOME Sink & Shop, Hyper Tubes, Dune Desert reworked as a new starting area, rebalancing the entire game, a bunch of optimisations, a whole lot of quality of life features, and so much more. These are probably the longest patch notes we’ve ever written for Satisfactory. Go check them out below and/or read more about Update 3 on our website. 

<https://update3.satisfactorygame.com/>

All saves previously played on Early Access should load. Now, if you do load up an old save that hasn’t seen any of the Update 3 content yet, instead of starting a new game, proceed with caution. Due to the rebalance and recipe changes your existing factory buildings will either not produce parts or function below optimal efficiency. All generators other than Biomass and Geothermal require fluids now, so they won’t run until you set them up correctly. This means your factory will most likely not have any power on start-up. 

We also did changes to the creature respawn system. They now respawn within 2-3 in game days if no powered factory building is nearby and they won’t despawn until you have killed them once. Those changes mean that all creatures killed in a pre-update 3 save will return once, even in factories. Any creature that has been removed once should not respawn again in powered factories. There are some edge cases of creatures stuck within Foundations that pop out of them at later times, so you might have to clean house a few times before they are all gone for good. 

Any issues you still find on Early Access or feedback you have for us you can report via our questions site. We also reply and update status on issues that we are aware of and sometimes ask for more information, so keep an eye on issues you report or are interested in. You can find the questions site here: 

<https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/>

Seeing so many people enjoy Update 3 on Experimental has been a blast. I hope all of you joining now on Early Access will have an amazing time with it as well. Looking forward to your feedback and reactions! <3

  * Fall damage is a bit more linear now


  * Creatures now respawn after several in-game days if no powered factory is present around their spawn area


  * Creatures will no longer disappear without being killed



## Optimization

  * Factory tick parallelization: Spreading out the factory tick over more cores if available. This can considerably improve factory performance, depending on the CPU
  * Memory optimizations
  * Disk space optimizations (the Experimental version should take up considerably less space than before)
  * Cleaned out & removed unnecessary foliage variants
  * Cached savefiles more often, to reduce the amount of disk access to remove hitches when using a mechanical HDD
  * Fixed so that Static Meshes placed in the world now can have a lower resolution shadow and nice LOD transition at the same time
  * Optimized collision shapes on Conveyor Belts which reduces the number of uObjects and allows for larger factories before the limit is reached
  * Fixed performance issues when trying to place Conveyor Belts longer than the allowed limit



## Quality of Life

  * Different stackable poles can now be stacked with each other
  * Added the ability to skip [Onboarding](/wiki/Onboarding "Onboarding") from the new game menu and start with Tier 1

  * Move all stacks of the same type between inventories with Ctrl + click
  * Power Poles, Conveyor Poles & Pipeline Support placed when building Power Lines now snap to the foundation grid
  * Players can now set part per minute when Overclocking instead of the only percentage
  * The game now saves and restarts automatically after running for 24 hours consecutively to prevent all sorts of bugs that can occur after that time
  * Mass dismantling buildings now creates a single [crate](/wiki/Crate "Crate") when the resources don’t fit into the inventory, instead of a crate per buildable dismantled
  * When aiming at the workbench on a vehicle, only the workbench is outlined, and not the entire vehicle
  * Players should be able to jump out of the water now
  * Splitters and Mergers now snap onto Conveyor endpoints and directly onto Conveyor Poles as well



## Networking

  * Added relay server support, this means that if you can’t connect with NAT punch-through, we will relay the data through a third-party server, allowing connection at the cost of additional ping
  * Lowered connection timeout from 60s to 30s
  * Build modes are now simulated on client, which should result in improved responsiveness and accuracy
