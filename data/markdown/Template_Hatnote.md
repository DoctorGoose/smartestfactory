# Template:Hatnote

[](/wiki/File:Template-info.svg) Documentation

[[purge](https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Template:Hatnote?action=purge)]

Using `{{Hatnote}}` formats text into the standard stylistic for a wiki hatnote. That produces a short note placed at the top of an article to provide disambiguation of closely related terms or summarise a topic, explaining its boundaries. 

## Function

This template is primarily used to add a correctly formatted _hatnote_ to a page. Often, but not always, this is a _disambiguation link_ at the top of article pages. It places an HTML `div-` / `div` block around the text entered as its only argument, which provides standardized formatting (contents are indented and italicized in most displays); it also isolates the contained code to make sure that it is interpreted correctly. 

This template is also used as the "meta-template" for additional specialized disambiguation link templates. 

The template does not automatically create links of any kind. Links and other desired formatting must be explicitly added, using normal wiki markup.
