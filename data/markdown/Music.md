_Satisfactory_ features its own **music** soundtrack, composed by Jannik Reuterberg aka Sleeper's Delight aka Dream Thing.[1]

In-game music is ambient. Tracks are tied to the [biome](/wiki/World "World"), time of day and player actions, such as factory building or exploration. A unique track plays on the [title screen](/wiki/Title_screen "Title screen"). 

Additionally, the [](/wiki/Boom_Box "Boom Box") [Boom Box](/wiki/Boom_Box "Boom Box") can be used to play Tapes, which feature their own set of tracks. 

According to [CSS Sound Designer Sacha Mathelet](/wiki/Coffee_Stain_Studios#Coffee_Stain_Studios "Coffee Stain Studios"), all music is streamed from the players hard drive and not from memory (RAM).[2]

## Trivia

  * The music used in Dev Highlight Videos was originally a demo written for an alternate, unreleased trailer.[10]
  * The soundtrack was previously intended to be released alongside 1.0.[11]
  * Many tracks are named after psychological phenomena. Explained briefly, these are: 
    * **Pygmalion effect** \- higher expectations yield greater results, lower expectations yield worse results.
    * **Peltzman effect** \- if the risk of an activity is perceived as low, people tend to act less cautiously.
    * **Zeigarnik effect** \- if an activity is interrupted, it is more easily recalled.
    * Fan effect - the more one knows about a concept, the longer it takes to recall specific information about it.
    * **Dunning-Kruger effect** \- people with limited competence in a given field overestimate their abilities while more experienced people tend to underestimate their abilities.
    * **C-Parks effect** \- named after Caterina Parks, CEO of FICSIT Inc. This is a fictitious psychological effect with no known description.
    * **Ringelmann effect** \- the more people are in a group, the less productive individual members become.
    * **Crespi effect** \- if the previous task was not as rewarding as expected, less effort is put into the next, and vice versa.
  * Some other song names are based on non-English names or expressions: 
    * **Sirocco** \- also known as Scirocco. A hot, fast Mediterranean wind coming from the Sahara.
    * **Silva** \- Latin for "woodland" or "forest"
    * **Post Tenebras** \- Latin for "after darkness"



## Current issues
