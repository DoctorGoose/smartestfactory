### Release date

**10 September 2024** at 3:00 PM (UTC/GMT) / 5:00 PM CEST.[1.0 1][1.0 2][1.0 3]

### Save file compatibility

It will be possible to load save files from Update 8, with considerable limitations:[1.0 4]

  * You will not be able to experience the story in full, a major feature of version 1.0. 
    * This will, however, not prevent the completion of the game.[1.0 4]
  * Some [Milestones](/wiki/Milestones "Milestones") and [MAM](/wiki/MAM "MAM") Research unlocks will have to be unlocked again.
  * Resource node changes will cause [Miners](/wiki/Miner "Miner") on affected nodes to produce differently, or stop working entirely if the node is relocated.
  * Recipe changes will cause the efficiency of factories using certain recipes to be reduced. Some factories will stop working entirely.
  * [Achievements](/wiki/Achievements "Achievements") will not be granted retroactively.
  * Foliage in the [world](/wiki/World "World") will regrow.



### Story

  * Satisfactory will have story content, which is fully written and being prototyped.[1.0 5][1.0 6]
  * The story will be mandatory if you want to complete the game.[1.0 7]
    * Continuing on an Update 8 save file will not properly trigger story triggers, which will however not prevent completing the game (see § Save file compatibility).[1.0 4]
    * Some items may be unlocked exclusively through the story.[1.0 8]
  * The story will not be the primary focus of the game, being referred to more as a "narrative".[1.0 9]
  * The story will be linear[1.0 10] and not contain any cutscenes.[1.0 11][1.0 12]
  * The story was written by [Hannah Beuger](https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Coffee_Stain_Studios#Hannah).[1.0 13]
  * The story has been made smaller than envisioned.[1.0 14]
  * All story dialog will be recorded in the [Codex](/wiki/Codex "Codex") for future reference.[1.0 15]
  * The use of [SAM](/wiki/SAM_Ore "SAM Ore"), [Mercer Spheres](/wiki/Mercer_Sphere "Mercer Sphere"), and [Somersloops](/wiki/Somersloop "Somersloop") will be properly implemented.[1.0 16][1.0 17][1.0 18][1.0 19][1.0 20]
    * Both Mercer Spheres and Somersloops will not be "story items", but will have some relevance to the narrative and a purpose in game.[1.0 21]
  * The characters of [Caterina Parks](/wiki/Caterina_Parks "Caterina Parks") (the CEO of [FICSIT](/wiki/FICSIT_Inc. "FICSIT Inc.")) and [Steve](/wiki/Steve "Steve") (Caterina's assistant) are not being added to the game.[1.0 22]
  * When using [Multiplayer](/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer"), all co-op players will see the story whenever a Milestone, Project Assembly Phase, or MAM Research is completed. Other individual story elements will only be revealed to individuals based on proximity.[1.0 23]



### Space Elevator

[](/wiki/File:Project_Assembly_Teaser.png)

[](/wiki/File:Project_Assembly_Teaser.png "Enlarge")

Project Assembly _(partly assembled]_ as seen in story video.[1.0 24]

Phase 4, originally designed to be a placeholder, and now titled "Propulsion", is being changed to reduce the amounts required to complete as follows:[1.0 25]

Component | Update 8 | 1.0   
---|---|---  
[](/wiki/Assembly_Director_System "Assembly Director System") [Assembly Director System](/wiki/Assembly_Director_System "Assembly Director System") | 4000 | 500   
[](/wiki/Magnetic_Field_Generator "Magnetic Field Generator") [Magnetic Field Generator](/wiki/Magnetic_Field_Generator "Magnetic Field Generator") | 4000 | 500   
[](/wiki/Thermal_Propulsion_Rocket "Thermal Propulsion Rocket") [Thermal Propulsion Rocket](/wiki/Thermal_Propulsion_Rocket "Thermal Propulsion Rocket") | 1000 | 250   
[](/wiki/Nuclear_Pasta "Nuclear Pasta") [Nuclear Pasta](/wiki/Nuclear_Pasta "Nuclear Pasta") | 1000 | 100   
  
Phase 5 is being added, containing Tier 9.[1.0 26] Beside the story, most of the 1.0 update is within the late game. 

Project Assembly is now visible in-game. Notably, it looks different than in the 2018 E3 trailer. 

Player will see Project Assembly "assembled" as they complete Phases.[1.0 27]

### Milestones

  * Tier 9, which will be the last tier in the game,[1.0 26] and feature the most complex production chains.[1.0 28]
    * Features new buildings and recipes to craft the final Space Elevator parts along with ways to convert resources, create [Power Shards](/wiki/Power_Shard "Power Shard"), and use [Plutonium Waste](/wiki/Plutonium_Waste "Plutonium Waste") to make a new power source.
    * Will have Alternate Recipes.[1.0 29]



### MAM

  * [Hard Drive Research](/wiki/Hard_Drive_Research "Hard Drive Research")
    * Added new tab called Hard Drive Library. The library allows storing scanned Hard Drives without immediately choosing a reward, allowing inexperienced players to [search online](/wiki/Hard_Drive "Hard Drive") for help about which reward to pick, and advanced players to choose their rewards more strategically.[1.0 30]
    * Storing multiple Hard Drives in the library narrows down the pool of rewards for newly scanned and re-rolled drives, as rewards will not repeat.[1.0 31] This increases the likelihood of obtaining a desired reward, as the pool is reduced by two options instead of just one (the selected reward).
    * In order to reduce decision paralysis, two recipe choices are presented instead of three.[1.0 32] However, it is possible to re-roll the rewards once, thus being able to choose from four unique alternate recipes from a single Hard Drive.[1.0 33] Re-rolling is also limited by other Hard Drives in the library, just like scanning a Hard Drive anew.[1.0 31]
  * [Alien Organisms Research](/wiki/Alien_Organisms_Research "Alien Organisms Research")[1.0 34]
    * Renamed to Alien Megafauna.
  * Classified Phenomena Research[1.0 34]
    * New Alien Tech research tree.[1.0 35]
    * You get access to Dimensional Depot when you unlock Steel (Tier 4).
    * You get access to Alien Production Amplification once you reach Tier 5.
    * You get access to Alien Power Augmenters when you reach Tier 6.

### New fluids

[](/wiki/File:Teaser_1.0_Fluids.png)

[](/wiki/File:Teaser_1.0_Fluids.png "Enlarge")

New fluids in 1.0.  
Left: Dark Matter Residue. Right: Excited Photonic Matter.

  * Excited Photonic Matter[1.0 56]
    * Produced in the Converter, requiring no solid or fluid inputs.
    * Not a solid, liquid, gas, or plasma,[1.0 57] but does behave like a gas in the game. It is its own thing. There is the explanation given in the video from CSS Game Designer Mark Hofma: 
      * _In essence, excited photonic matter is a quantum state of matter that doesn't fit into the classical categories of gas, solid, liquid, or plasma. It's an emergent phenomenon that arises from the interactions between light and matter at the quantum level._
  * Dark Matter Residue[1.0 2]
    * Produced by the Quantum Encoder as a byproduct in every recipe.
    * Can also be produced in the Converter.[1.0 58]
    * Can not be packaged, so you need to make Dark Matter Crystals and then sink those.
  * Rocket Fuel[1.0 59]
    * An extension to the Turbofuel production chain.
    * Made by combining Nitric Acid and Turbofuel in Blender. Produces a Compacted Coal byproduct.
    * Can be used in Vehicles, Fuel Generators and have a burn rate of 4.167 m3/min. 
      * Therefore, its energy is 3600 MJ/m3 (Turbofuel has 2000 MJ/m3 for reference).
    * Can also be used in the Jetpack, and will provide highly accelerated launch. But it does burn quickly.
  * Ionized Fuel[1.0 60]
    * An extension to the Turbofuel production chain.
    * Made by combining Rocket Fuel and Power Shards (once automatable in Tier 9) in the Refinery. Produces a Compacted Coal byproduct.
    * Can be used in Vehicles, Fuel Generators and have a burn rate of 3 m3/min. 
      * Therefore, its energy is 5000 MJ/m3 (Turbofuel has 2000 MJ/m3 for reference).
    * Can also be used in the Jetpack, and will provide highly accelerated launch and slow consumption rate. Ionized Fuel does have a lower velocity ceiling than Rocket Fuel.

  * Quantum Encoder[1.0 2][1.0 61]
    * 3 Conveyor Belt inputs, 1 pipeline input.
    * 1 Conveyor Belt output, 1 Pipeline output.
    * All recipes in the Quantum Encoder require Excited Photonic Matter and output Dark Matter Residue.[1.0 62]
    * Power usage fluctuates a lot more compared to Particle Accelerators and Converters.
  * Converter[1.0 63][1.0 64][1.0 65]
    * An Octahedral Dome building with 2 Conveyor Belt inputs, 1 Conveyor Belt output, and 1 Pipeline output.
    * Built using SAM Fluctuators.[1.0 66]
    * Shown producing Excited Photonic Matter.
    * Is able to convert raw resources like Iron Ore, Coal, Limestone, etc into each other at the cost of Reanimated SAM.
    * Used to produce Ficsite Ingots
    * Power usage fluctuates.[1.0 67]
  * Conveyor Belt Mk.6 
    * Seen at end of Quantum Technology video[1.0 68] and later confirmed.[1.0 69]
    * 1200 items/min.
    * Deviates from the existing Conveyor Belt design pattern, appearing much closer to the Mk.3 belt than the Mk.5 belt.
  * Conveyor Lift Mk.6 
    * Along with confirmed Mk.6 Conveyor Belts.[1.0 70]
    * 1200 items/min.
    * Does not show items traveling through, rather has a closed design.
  * Blueprint Designer Mk.2[1.0 71]
    * Size of 40x40x40m (5x5 foundations, 10 walls tall).

  * Alien Power Augmenter[1.0 72]
    * Teased in a video[1.0 73] and later on a Dev Stream.[1.0 74]
    * Shown prominently using a [Somersloop](/wiki/Somersloop "Somersloop") which takes the existing power grid and "augments" it to make it better.
    * When placed, the Power Augmenter will automatically generate 500 MW of power by itself.
    * When a Power Augmenter is connected to a power grid circuit it will augment that circuit by 10%. Free Power at the cost of using one Somersloop. This means it is not unlimited, since Somesloops are a limited resource.
    * Alien Power Augmenters Stack 
      * While you can build multiple Alien Power Augmenters, all connected to a single power circuit (grid), they don't "boost" power boosts by other Alien Power Augmenters but simply add a power boost from the base power value for the augmented circuit.
      * Power Storage is NOT included in calculating the power boost from a Alien Power Augmenter.
      * Has another, currently unknown function.[1.0 75]
  * Dimensional Depot Uploader[1.0 76]
    * Using Mercer Spheres you will be able to make the Dimensional Depot Uploader, which is a type of storage container.
    * Uploads items to the Dimensional Depot[1.0 77]
      * The Dimensional Depot is linked to your personal Inventory.
      * Items placed in the Dimensional Depot Uploader will be available anywhere on the map by accessing it in your Inventory and downloading the item from the Dimensional Depot. No need for storage hubs.
      * Items in your Inventory can be placed into the Dimensional Depot as needed.
      * There are limited slots, and while downloading from the Dimensional Depot is instant, uploading takes time.
    * Stack Sizes and Upload Speeds are initially limited but there is a method in the MAM[1.0 78] to increase both Dimensional Depot allowable stack sizes as well as the Dimensional Depot upload speeds.
    * If when building you run out of a needed ingredient in your main Inventory, it will automatically grab the ingredient from the Dimensional Depot (if available).[1.0 79]
      * There will be an checkbox which you can specify if you want the build parts to come from the Dimensional Depot first or from your main Inventory first.
      * The Dimensional Depot can only be accessed via the inventory, not automatically for any production lines.
    * A completed rendition of the old unreleased [Remote Storage](/wiki/Old_unreleased_content#Remote_Storage "Old unreleased content").
  * New Barrier Types.[1.0 80]
    * In both 1 meter and 4 meter versions.
  * New Fences in both clear and opaque types.[1.0 80]
    * Chain link fence. This is very fine, noticeable only by its interference pattern in the video.
    * Glass fence[1.0 81]
  * New Window Types.[1.0 80]
    * 5 new types of windows.

### Biome changes

[](/wiki/File:Post-Update_8_Roadmap_for_Map_Changes.png)

[](/wiki/File:Post-Update_8_Roadmap_for_Map_Changes.png "Enlarge")

Post-Update 8 Roadmap for Map Changes

The following changes are planned: 

  * Western Beaches, Western Dune Forest and Blue Crater biomes will receive "mild to significant foliage changes" and "minor landscape changes unlikely to meaningfully impact factory."[1.0 107]
  * Jungle Spires, Bamboo Fields and Southern Forest biomes will receive "mild to significant foliage changes" and "landscape changes that MAY impact factory."[1.0 107]
  * Paradise Islands will not receive further change, but will not be removed.[1.0 107] Instead, the [world border](/wiki/World_border "World border") will be moved to allow Pioneers to fully utilize Paradise Island.[1.0 108]
  * The rest of the world will only receive minor polish and half of it will have some fixes to water.[1.0 109]
  * All water features, including waterfalls, will be reworked.[1.0 110]
  * There will not be a snow biome in the game.[1.0 111]



### Resource Node changes

  * [](/wiki/File:Added_nodes_in_1.0.png "Added nodes")

Added nodes

  * [](/wiki/File:Removed_nodes_in_1.0.png "Removed nodes")

Removed nodes

  * [](/wiki/File:Increased_purity_nodes_in_1.0.png "Nodes with increased purity")

Nodes with increased purity

  * [](/wiki/File:Decreased_purity_nodes_in_1.0.png "Nodes with decreased purity")

Nodes with decreased purity




Resource Nodes are changing to incentivize exploration and spreading out.[1.0 112] This is done by adding or removing nodes, changing their purity or location. The overall amount of maximum resources per minute is increasing. 

The re-introduction of Mk.6 Conveyor Belts was one of the driving forces behind all the Resource Node changes.[1.0 113]

SAM Ore Resource Nodes will behave as any other node, allowing a continuous extraction of [](/wiki/SAM_Ore "SAM Ore") [SAM Ore](/wiki/SAM_Ore "SAM Ore"). 

### Geysers

12 additional [Geysers](/wiki/Geothermal_Generator#Geyser-0 "Geothermal Generator") have been added all over the Map, increasing the total number of Geysers from 18 to 30.[1.0 114][1.0 115][1.0 116]

Some existing Geysers had their purity levels decreased one level, while some other existing Geysers had no change. 

  * [](/wiki/File:Version_1.0_-_New_Geysers.png "Version 1.0 New Geysers added.")

Version 1.0 New Geysers added.

  * [](/wiki/File:Version_1.0_-_All_Geysers.png "Version 1.0 all Geysers.")

  * [](/wiki/File:Version_1.0_-_All_Geysers_Updated.png "Geyser changes in 1.0")

Geyser changes in 1.0




### Other features

  * [Achievements](/wiki/Achievements "Achievements")[1.0 117] There will be Achievements for those using Steam or Epic Games.[1.0 118][1.0 119]
    * The use of [Advanced Game Settings](/wiki/Advanced_Game_Settings "Advanced Game Settings") will disable the ability for all achievements to be awarded.[1.0 120][1.0 121]
    * The use of [Game Mods](https://ficsit.app/mods?p=0) will not disable the ability for achievements to be awarded.[1.0 122][1.0 123]
  * The look of the [Pioneer model](/wiki/Pioneer#Model "Pioneer") will change.[1.0 124]
  * [Crab Boss](/wiki/Crab_Boss "Crab Boss") will not be in 1.0.[1.0 125]
  * At least one additional track will be added to the Soundtrack in 1.0.[1.0 126]
  * Completion of World Perimeter started in Update 8.[1.0 127][1.0 128]
  * The look of water has been changed and improved.[1.0 110][1.0 129]
  * Swimming will be faster, and any [Death Crates](/wiki/Crate#Death_crate "Crate") will not spawn underwater.[1.0 130]
  * New Window designs introduced.[1.0 131]
  * Alien Production Amplification[1.0 132]
    * Somersloops will be used for Alien Production Amplification which allows you to further overclock all buildings and machines in the game which affects the Production Output.
    * Alien Production Amplification will cost more power, and varies by building and/or machine where it is used.



### Quality of Life Improvements

  * During construction you only need to aim at a building and based on the what you are constructing game will automatically select the proper connection _(input or output port, power connecter, etc.)._[1.0 133]
  * Guidelines which show when you hold down [`Left Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") have changed:[1.0 134]
    * They will show a Green Line for Inputs.
    * They will show a Red Line for Outputs.
    * They will show a Blue Line for "Center Mass" when aligning building to building.
    * Also Inputs and Outputs will show a moving dashed line showing direction that items or fluid will travel.[1.0 135]
  * Conveyor Belts Build Modes.[1.0 136]
    * Default Mode where they will build like they do now to include clipping.
    * NEW Straight Mode that will now auto-correct to prevent clipping (if possible) making straight belts with perfect 90° corners.
    * NOTE: This has not been implemented for Pipelines yet.
  * Railways can use [`Left Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to get straight railways.[1.0 137]
  * Chainsaw Modes.[1.0 138]
    * Area Mode to remove anything within the Chainsaws Area-of-Effect (AoE).
    * Single Mode to only remove the highlighted object.



### Optimizations

1.0 will include several game optimizations:[1.0 139]

  * The "colliders" for various types of [Foliage](/wiki/Flora "Flora") are being removed from [Vehicles](/wiki/Vehicles "Vehicles"), which will result in the inability to destroy most smaller foliage by driving a Vehicle over them.[1.0 140]
  * Both [Conveyor Belts](/wiki/Conveyor_Belts "Conveyor Belts") and [Pipelines](/wiki/Pipelines "Pipelines") individual segments will be "pooled" into one instance group, thereby reducing the CPU computational load.[1.0 141]
  * The [rendering of shadows](/wiki/Unreal_Engine#Virtual_Shadow_Maps_\(VSM\) "Unreal Engine") will improve by use of bigger instance pools allowing for faster computation.[1.0 142]
  * Certain Buildables that don't produce items, nor are interacted with by the Player, called Lightweight Actors, are being converted into "Data Only Objects". This will result in faster game load times, quicker saving times, along with smaller save file sizes, and the overall reduction of UObjects used in game. Common examples of Data Only Objects are Foundations, Walls, Railings, Stairs, etc.[1.0 143][1.0 144]
  * All the machine animations in the game will be processed in the GPU and use [Vertex Animations](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/AnimatingObjects/SkeletalMeshAnimation/Tools/VertexAnimationTool/) instead of standard animations.[1.0 145][1.0 146]
  * Other optimizations include:[1.0 147]
    * Memory improvements that will lower the VRAM requirements for everyone.
    * Scalability improvements making changes from a lower setting to a higher setting, or vice-versa, better.
    * Unreal Engine 5.3 which comes with some performance improvements due to Epic fixing some issues in UE 5.2, and also had the benefit of fixing some game crashes that players were experiencing.
    * Upgraded upscalers - both Nvidia Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) and AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution (FSR) have been upgraded to their respective latest versions.



### Dedicated servers

In 1.0, [Dedicated servers](/wiki/Dedicated_servers "Dedicated servers") will be receiving changes and improvements:[1.0 148][1.0 149]

  * Easier to install by reducing the install size.
  * Will only use one port, that being UDP/TCP 7777.
  * Support for both IPv4 and IPv6.
  * Being able to choose between a GUI console application and a terminal application.
  * Support for Transport Layer Security (TLS) end-to-end encryption for both server and game data/traffic.
  * Improved console screen.
  * Easier to create new game sessions.
  * Support for use of [Advanced Game Settings](/wiki/Advanced_Game_Settings "Advanced Game Settings").
  * Easier to set up [server configuration settings](/wiki/Dedicated_servers/Configuration_files "Dedicated servers/Configuration files").
  * Server admins will now be able to download the save file directly from within the Server Manager.
  * Autosave and server status notifications will be sent to all clients. 
    * This also will apply to [player-hosted multiplayer sessions](/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer").
  * Support for [HTTP API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API "wikipedia:Web API") methods between the server and client. 
    * Future mod support will allow use of the HTTP API to perform functions from within mods, and to extend the API functionality.
  * Ability to do level streaming.[1.0 147]



### Online subsystem

1.0 will feature improvements to the online subsystem.[1.0 150] The noted changes are: 

  * Ability to use Steam Online Service for Steam players.
  * Ability to disable the online subsystem if players know they won't be doing any [multiplayer](/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer") sessions.
  * Ability to connect to a specific IP Address for those who are familiar with networking.



### Toilet Flush

Flushing of the toilet in the [HUB](/wiki/HUB "HUB").[1.0 151]. The animation of the "flush" will be in a clockwise direction.[1.0 152][1.0 153]

Originally announced as downloadable content (DLC) and repeatedly confirmed afterwards (via statements/jokes with varying degrees of deadpan delivery).[DLC 1][DLC 2] The planned cost was $1.[DLC 3][DLC 4][DLC 5] A related Toilet Paper DLC was also hinted at,[DLC 6] with each square to cost $5.[DLC 2]
