## Intro

Hi Pioneers! 

Here it is, Update 4 out on Experimental. Before you read through everything here, you might want to check out our Patch Notes video showcasing all the cool new stuff that has been added to Satisfactory in this update. Here is the link to the video: 

We’ve already teased and showcased a bunch of the content that you are getting with this patch, but there are some spicy surprises we were hiding until the release. Now Satisfactory is taking to the air with Aerial Transportation for your resources and the Hover Pack to make factory building and traversal extra smooth. Additionally, we have added Lights to the game in a way that should not immediately destroy your performance. We are still working on them, but we hope you will already find them quite enjoyable. On top of this the Power Storage and Generator changes will affect how you deal with dreaded blackouts and the updated Tier 7 and added Tier 8 bring a whole lot of new late game content for you to play with. Together with the new content we’ve also worked on lots of smaller and bigger changes across the game to improve it, there are improvements to networking, optimisations, UI, quality of life, all the good stuff. You can find the full list in the patch notes below. 

Of course, this is the initial Experimental release of Update 4 and that means we are still actively working on many of these features and improvements, but now we want you to try them out and give us feedback. If you find issues or have feedback for us, you can post it on the Questions Site or upvote existing posts to let us know what is important to you. The site can be found here: <https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/> We are expecting this update to spend around a month on Experimental for us to be able to react to your feedback and fix everything up nicely for the Early Access release. With that in mind we are aiming for it to be fully released on the 13th of April. Fingers crossed on that for all of you waiting for the update to be stable! 

Since we are still actively working on this content there are some issues known to us that you can find in their own section at the end of the patch notes if you want to check them first before switching to Experimental. 

Update 4 is one of the biggest updates we have made so far. We started working on it after summer last year alongside 3.5, so it is super exciting to finally share it with all of you. Hope y’all are going to enjoy it a lot! 

Cheers and thank you for playing and sharing the awesome stuff you do in Satisfactory <3
