## Usage

A controller can be used for both the desktop release or [console release](/wiki/Console_release "Console release") of the game. 

### PC external settings

#### Steam

After connecting your Controller to your PC, open Steam, and go to `Settings > Controller` and change _External Gamepad Settings_ as follows: 

  * **Xbox controller:**
    * _Enable Steam Input for Xbox controllers_ set to _Enabled_.
    * _Xbox Extended Feature Support Driver_ , it is also recommended this be installed.
  * **Playstation controller:**
    * _PlayStation Controller Support_ set to _Enabled_.
  * All other Steam settings leave in default setting.



After setting up Steam controller support, in Steam go to `Library > Satisfactory Game`, right-click on game, go to `Controller`, and set _Override for Satisfactory_ to _Enable Steam Input_. 

#### Epic games launcher

Epic Games Launcher does not have any controller settings. To set up a Xbox or Playstation controller for Satisfactory using the launcher, you should add the Epic Games Launcher to your Steam library as a non-Steam game as follows: 

  * Ensure the Epic Games Launcher is closed.
  * After connecting your Controller to your PC, open Steam, and go to `Games > Add a non-Steam game to my library`, select the Epic Games Launcher, and add it.
  * Once launcher is added, if not already done so, set up your Controller for Steam as shown above. Once that is done, just click "Play" on the Epic Games Launcher in Steam to launch the launcher, and select game. Steam overlay should now be active for game.



### PC in-game settings

**NOTE:** Both Playstation and Xbox Controllers on PC require Steam Input. Make sure the external settings shown above for your controller are completed first. 

Once external settings have been completed, to use a controller on PC, it must be turned on, and **first enabled** in-game via [Options > Controls > General](/wiki/Settings#Controls "Settings") by setting **Select Controls** to _Controller_ followed by clicking **[Apply] Button**. 

  * Once you enable _Controller_ by applying change, you can then change **Controller Type** to either _Xbox Series X/S_ , or Playstation _DuelSense_.
  * **IMPORTANT:** In the [Options > Controls > Controller](/wiki/Settings#Controller_2 "Settings") menu, it is recommended to keep the **KBM Switch on Controller Disconnection** setting enabled so you will automatically switch back to keyboard and mouse when a controller is disconnected or cannot be found.



## Controls

_Main article:_[ Controls > Controller](/wiki/Controls#Controller "Controls")

## Steam Deck

The game recognizes the Steam Deck and defaults to controller input automatically. 

Steam Input is enabled by default and the Steam Virtual Keyboard can be used if desired.
