The following replacement cipher was used to present a presumably alien message in a [Tweet from CSS](https://x.com/SatisfactoryAF/status/1827964196992028750?s=35) on August 26, 2024 that read `₩₥₴₱ ɄɎ₮₵Q JɎ₦ ɎⱤ ₥₴₱ Q₣₥₱₵Q. Ʉ₣₵Ⱡ Ʉ₲JJ ₩₥₴ JɎⱠ฿? ฿₵Đ₲J₵ Ɽ₣₵ Q₳₱₲₦Ɽ₴₱₵` that when decrypted stated "**Your waves lap at our shores When will you land? Defile the scripture** ". This phrase was spoken near the end of a recent video teaser[1] and is thought to be sent by some as yet unknown race that we may be introduced to in the final release as part of the story line. 

It is unclear if similar messages will carry over and appear in-game for the initial 1.0 release, but additional messages may help flush out the remainder of the alphabet. It is also unclear if future messages in 1.0 would be translated from English or use a localized language. There may also be numeric symbols yet to be presented. If so, they may not be base 10 numbers and require all the arabic numbers 0-9. 

Latin characters (the traditional alphabet used for US/UK English) shown below with no alien counterpart were not used in the original message and remain unknown. At least some punctuation appears to be literally presented (e.g. ? =?)

This is a form of simple substitution where each letter has a visually similar counterpart from the alien alphabet, with a consistent shift for each letter. Starting from the Latin letter C, the alien alphabet looks like A, B, C, and so on. 

Latin Letter | Alien Letter | Possible Symbols   
---|---|---  
B |  | 𝒵, 𝔷, ᴻ, Ʒ, Ẕ   
G |  | 𝓔, 𝔼, ǝ, 𝕰, 𐌄, Ǝ, ᴂ   
J |  | 𝓗, 𝔥, 𝖧, Ħ, Ⱨ, ẖ, Ḧ   
K |  | 𝓘, 𝔦, 𝖨, ɨ, 유, Ḭ, Ḯ, ῗ   
M |  | 𝓚, 𝖪, 𝑲,Ⱪ, ḵ, ₭, Ḱ, Ḵ   
Q |  | 𝓞, 𝔬, 𝕺, ᴼ, Ṑ, Ṓ   
X |  | 𝓋, 𝔳, 𝕍, ᐯ, Ṽ, Ṿ   
Z |  | 𝒳, 𝔵, 𝖷, 𐌗, Ẍ, ẍ
