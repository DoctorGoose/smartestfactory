**The HUB** , or "Habitat and Utility Base", is the heart of the factory and the first build-able structure in-game. Initially only containing a [Craft Bench](/wiki/Craft_Bench "Craft Bench") and the HUB Terminal, it can be upgraded as the [pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer") progresses along the [Milestones](/wiki/Milestones "Milestones") in [Tier 0](/wiki/Tier_0 "Tier 0"). The completed HUB, in addition, contains two small [Biomass Burners](/wiki/Biomass_Burner "Biomass Burner"), a FICSIT Freighter, and living quarters, also functioning as the pioneers' respawn point. The HUB Terminal, which is the main progression tool, allows pioneers to advance through tiers of Milestones.

## Construction

The HUB is constructed using 20x[](/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore") [Iron Ore](/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore"), obtained by dismantling the starting [Drop-pod](/wiki/Drop-pod "Drop-pod"). The HUB is then progressively upgraded via the HUB Terminal (see below) throughout [Onboarding](/wiki/Onboarding "Onboarding"), unless it's skipped while starting a new game. 

Dismantling the HUB returns the Iron Ore required to build it, retaining all upgrades and Milestone progress, including inserted parts; if there are items stored in the HUB's [Personal Storage Box](/wiki/Personal_Storage_Box "Personal Storage Box"), the stored items will be transferred to the pioneer's inventory. This means it can be freely relocated, just like all other player-built structures. 

Only one HUB can be built, even if the pioneer has more than 20x Iron Ore. Through means such as save editing, multiple HUBs can exist in the world at once and will function identically. The oldest HUB appears to be used when respawning.

## Features

Aside from what is listed below, the HUB contains a [Craft Bench](/wiki/Craft_Bench "Craft Bench") and a [Personal Storage Box](/wiki/Personal_Storage_Box "Personal Storage Box"), which function identically to their standalone variants. 

[Respawning](/wiki/Health "Health") and joining a [multiplayer](/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer") game positions pioneers in front of the toilet cubicle within the living quarters. If no HUB is placed, pioneers respawn and join in the starting location picked at the start of the game. 

### Front

The front of the HUB is the side with the door to the living quarters.

### Biomass Burners

_Main article:_[Biomass Burner](/wiki/Biomass_Burner "Biomass Burner")

At the start, the HUB contains no Biomass Burners. The first one is unlocked at Tier 0 – HUB Upgrade 2, the second at HUB Upgrade 5. If Onboarding is skipped, both Burners are always available. 

Each Biomass Burner produces 20 MW of power, which is less than the standalone Biomass Burner, however, they also burn fuel proportionally slower, thus are just as energy-efficient. 

  * [](/wiki/File:HUB_Biomass_Burner_Comparison.png "Comparison between two models of Biomass Burners: Left: stand-alone \(30 MW\). Right: attached to the HUB \(20 MW\).")

### FICSIT Freighter

The FICSIT Freighter is unlocked at Tier 0: HUB Upgrade 6. During its unlock animation, it descends from space, turns around, then docks at the HUB where it waits to be launched into space upon Milestone completion. It will return to the HUB after a set amount of time which varies by Milestone, with its countdown timer located at the top right of the game screen and in the HUB Terminal. 

[Crashed FICSIT Freighters](/wiki/Crash_Site "Crash Site") can be found scattered across the world, containing [Hard Drives](/wiki/Hard_Drive "Hard Drive").

### Terminal

_Main article:_[Milestones](/wiki/Milestones "Milestones")

The HUB Terminal is the place where pioneers select _Milestones_ sorted by tiers and input the materials required to complete the selected [Milestone](/wiki/Milestone "Milestone") . This can be achieved by shift-click the relevant material in the [inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") or drag and drop. There are currently 10 tiers of Milestones to progress through Tier 0 to Tier 9. 

At the start, only Tier 0 is available as a part of **Onboarding** (unless it is skipped). Tier 0's Milestones, named HUB Upgrades, have to be completed in sequential order, unlike all following Tiers. After Tier 0 is finished, Tiers 1 and 2 become available. Further milestones are unlocked by sending deliveries through the [Space Elevator](/wiki/Space_Elevator "Space Elevator").

### Living Quarters

The living quarters are located between the Biomass Burners and the HUB terminal. Other than the Desk, Lockers, and Toilet, the remaining living quarters' amenities are mere decorations (i.e. bunk bed, cupboards, pantry, etc). 

In [Version 1.0](/wiki/Patch_1.0 "Patch 1.0") the living quarters was completely redesigned.

#### Operation SCADA-HMI Terminal Desk

The desk by the window is named the "Operation SCADA-HMI Terminal Desk" and can be interacted with to play a [FICSIT Productive Packer Deluxe](/wiki/FICSIT_Productive_Packer_Deluxe "FICSIT Productive Packer Deluxe") minigame. 

There are 3 upper monitors as follows: 

  * **Left:** This monitor only shows screensaver with a bouncing multi-colored FICSIT.
  * **Middle:** This monitor shows an "Update" being performed with a progress bar that completes one "cycle" every **10 minutes** _(twice the default Autosave time period)_. Upon completion of one "cycle" the "Update Restarts" after experience an unexpected error.
  * **Right:** This monitor shows names of players who helped during Closed Alpha. 
    * Below the upper right monitor is a card saying "Thank you Haigen" which is in reference to Haigen Miller, who created the [Official Satisfactory Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/) and helped the Coffee Stain Studio Game Developers so much that upon notice of his sudden death in 2025[1] they put this thank you card in the game as a tribute to him.

#### Bunk Beds

  * There are two bunk beds found in the HUB.
  * After completion of [Onboarding - HUB Upgrade 4](/wiki/Milestones#Tier_0:_Onboarding "Milestones"), and _prior to completion of HUB Upgrade 6_ , the pioneer can enter the bunk beds using the following methods:[2]
    * Use Crouch [`C`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") and **walk** onto lower bunk bed.
    * Use Crouch [`C`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") \+ [`Space`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") and **jump** onto upper bunk bed.
  * After completion of HUB Upgrade 6, and reaching Tier 1, the two bunk beds become mere decorations and cannot be used by pioneers.

#### Pantry

The pantry and cupboards are a mere decoration and cannot be used by pioneers, with the exception of the ability to interact [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") with the microwave, faucet, and coffee machine which will show an "action" as follows: 

  * **Microwave:** Will show a light for an average of **1 second** before sounding a ding at the end.
  * **Faucet:** Will show cold flowing water for an average of **0.75 seconds** before ending.
  * **Coffee machine:** Will show hot flowing brown liquid _(presumed coffee)_ for an average of **15 seconds** before ending

#### Toilet

The toilet can be interacted [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") with to insert any 1 item, and then flushed to destroy the item. 

  * The duration of the flush lasts for an average of **10 seconds** in total. There is an approximate **3.75 second delay** before the flush that lasts approximately **6.25 more seconds.**
  * NOTE: _ANY item_ can be inserted, including those which cannot be trashed in the inventory or aren't renewable, such as [Plutonium Waste](/wiki/Plutonium_Waste "Plutonium Waste"), [Hard Drives](/wiki/Hard_Drive "Hard Drive"), [Somersloops](/wiki/Somersloop "Somersloop") or [Mercer Spheres](/wiki/Mercer_Sphere "Mercer Sphere"). However, items which cannot be trashed also cannot be flushed.

#### Safety Scoreboard

Above the door, on the inside, there is a **Safety Scoreboard Sign** that records the number of in-game "days" since the last time the pioneer died and had to respawn in the HUB. One "day" on Massage-2(A-B)b lasts for 60 real-world minutes, so the "days" shown on the safety scoreboard are equal to the number of hours of playtime without a death "incident". 

The safety scoreboard has the ability to record up to **9999 days** which would equal 9999 real world hours. This would equal if played continuously without an "incident": 

  * 416.625 days, or 1.14066 years _(if played 24 hours per day)_ , or;
  * 1666.5 days, or 4.56263 years _(if played 6 hours per day)_ , or;
  * _Even longer if played less the 6 hours per day)_.

#### Special Decorations

In version 1.0 some special decorations were added to the HUB Living Quarters. 

  * On the Operation SCADA-HMI Terminal Desk there was a Golden Joystick added in [Patch 1.0.1.3](/wiki/Patch_1.0.1.3 "Patch 1.0.1.3") representing the IRL award of the 2024 Golden Joystick Award for PC Game of the Year.[3]
  * On the wall to the right of the toilet there was a Notice added in [Patch 1.0.1.4](/wiki/Patch_1.0.1.4 "Patch 1.0.1.4") encouraging Players to vote in the 2024 Steam Awards in the categories of Best with Friends and Most Innovative Gameplay.[4] The game was a finalist but did not win any award. Notice was removed in [Patch 1.0.1.5](/wiki/Patch_1.0.1.5 "Patch 1.0.1.5").

## Trivia

### General

  * The pre-alpha equivalent of the HUB was called the "Trading Post".[5] The HUB is still referred to as "TradingPost" internally.
  * You can target the HUB Terminal, the integrated Personal Storage Box, or the Craft Bench with the dismantle tool. Nothing happens if you actually try to dismantle them.
  * Inside the HUB, there use to be a computer screen with a phrase that says "See you Space Cowboy", a direct reference to 2000's anime Cowboy Bebop. This changed in [Patch 0.5.0.0](/wiki/Patch_0.5.0.0 "Patch 0.5.0.0") when the desk was redesigned.
  * The snuff can on the shelf near the pantry is based upon [this swedish snuff product](https://snusme.com/__media-service/img/product/556/GeneralClassicMini_snusme_s.webp).
  * The toilet used to have a recruitment poster on its wall. This poster was a reference to "[The Cycle](https://thecyclefrontier.fandom.com/wiki/The_Cycle_Wiki)", featuring one of the "Korolev" faction. It was removed in [Patch 1.1.1.4](/wiki/Patch_1.1.1.4 "Patch 1.1.1.4").
  * There use to be a cup on both the HUB Terminal and [Space Elevator](/wiki/Space_Elevator "Space Elevator") Terminal, with the name "Bry". This cup was removed in [Patch 1.0](/wiki/Patch_1.0 "Patch 1.0") when much of the previous planned story was replaced[6] by the current [Story](/wiki/Story "Story").



### FICSIT Freighter

  * During the Freighter launch, the [pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer") can stand on it and be slingshot to a very high altitude, from which the pioneer will be able to see the entire [map](/wiki/Map "Map"). Deaths and game crashes have been reported.
  * The Freighter can fly through the [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations") and any other [building](/wiki/Building "Building") built above it.
  * After completion of the launch animation, and before descending back to the HUB, it is possible to see the Freighter hovering distantly in the sky. During the day, it appears as a gray speck (see image below). At night, it is visible as a flickering light approximately the size of a star. It is unclear whether this is intentional (as a representation of the Freighter "unloading" its cargo to an orbital FICSIT facility), or simply a graphical glitch. It is also unclear whether this is visible at every graphical setting (initially confirmed on Ultra settings). 
    * The Freighter does not appear to despawn while on Milestone cooldown.
  * During the Freighter landing, if the pioneer stands at the Freighter docking position, it is possible to get stuck below the Freighter. To escape, dismantle the HUB.
  * The model number of the drop ship (5KY-3) is a reference to Skye from the Sanctum franchise.[7]

Prior to Closed Alpha, for most of the early game development there was no HUB, but in Sprint 12 (week 24) they added an equivalent of the HUB called a Trading Post.
