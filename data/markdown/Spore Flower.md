The **Spore Flower** is a hostile creature found in the [world](/wiki/World "World"). It appears as a large, brightly colored flower on the ground, with its bright blue stamen pointing directly up towards the sky. A closer look will reveal a set of six legs or roots tucked underneath the red petals of the plant. The central stamen is actually a head, with two small yellow eyes being visible. They nearly always appear in groups (of up to 15) and are incapable of movement besides standing up. 

The Spore Flower was first shown to the public in the Satisfactory E3 trailer.[1]

## Behavior

The Spore Flower will remain "dormant" (in its normal appearance in the world as detailed above) until the [pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer") approaches it, at which point it will slowly raise itself on its legs/roots. When finished, it will begin to unfurl its stamen, after which the plant will begin to shake the three fronds within - producing [Poison Gas](/wiki/Poison_Gas "Poison Gas"). 

This behavior can be halted by moving away from the plant, at which point it will perform the cycle in reverse - re-furling its stamen and lowering itself back onto the ground. Once the Spore Flower has begun to produce the poisonous gas, however, it will no longer respond to player presence, it will produce its gas for a few seconds and then go dormant again. 

The Spore Flower reacts to other creatures in the same manner it does to the pioneer. [Hogs](/wiki/Fluffy-tailed_Hog "Fluffy-tailed Hog") and [Spitters](/wiki/Spitter "Spitter") can be hurt by Poison Gas. [Stingers](/wiki/Stinger "Stinger") on the other hand are immune, but Spore Flowers will still attempt to attack them. 

Spore Flowers may be blown up with a Nobelisk. Prior to Update 1.0, Spore Flowers would simply vanish when blown up. Since Update 1.0, Spore Flowers play a short death animation after being blown up - the flower's blue leaves spread out and droop, fully revealing the stamen, and it lowers itself down quickly before disappearing. Once a Spore Flower is blown up, it will never respawn. 

### Combat

The Spore Flower does not take [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") from conventional weaponry (i.e. the [Xeno-Zapper](/wiki/Xeno-Zapper "Xeno-Zapper") or [Iron Rebar](/wiki/Iron_Rebar "Iron Rebar")) and is immune to the [Chainsaw](/wiki/Chainsaw "Chainsaw"), but can be removed by detonating a [Nobelisk](/wiki/Nobelisk "Nobelisk") (or [Explosive Rebar](/wiki/Explosive_Rebar "Explosive Rebar")) within range. Its hitbox is fairly sizeable, as a Nobelisk exploded at some distance from it is still able to remove it. Any gas produced by the Spore Flower will be removed instantly following its death. 

## Locations

The Spore Flower is most often found around the various collectibles and exploration rewards that can be found around the map such as [Somersloop](/wiki/Somersloop "Somersloop"), [Mercer Spheres](/wiki/Mercer_Sphere "Mercer Sphere"), [Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug"), and [Crash Sites](/wiki/Crash_Site "Crash Site"). 

There are 736 Spore Flowers in the world. 

## Trivia

  * Small, glowing insect-like creatures can be seen swarming around Spore Flowers. These creatures cannot be killed and stay even after the flower is destroyed. These creatures may hold a symbiotic relationship with the Spore Flowers.
  * Sometimes, the death animation does not cause the leaves to spread out.
