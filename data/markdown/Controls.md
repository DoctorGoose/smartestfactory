## In-game calculator

The Quick Search in-game `N` also serves as a simple calculator. The following operators are supported: 

  * `.`: Decimal
  * `+ - * /`: Arithmetic
  * `^`: Exponentiation / Power of
  * `%`: Remainder
  * `( )`: Parenthesis
  * `sqrt( )`: Square root



Other roots are possible using fractional exponentiation such as 8^(1/3)=2. The calculator enforces the order of operations.[4]

You can use similar formulas when entering values in a production building / machine UI for both [Clock Speed](/wiki/Clock_speed#Configuration "Clock speed") and Target Production Rate.
