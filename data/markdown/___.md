# ???

“  | _There are few songs about the first temple, it was a vessel-body but we were still shallow. The void swallowed our music and gave only silent lines. We started weaving in lines and we built many temples and then we discovered the curves. We started growing blood and altars and new orchestras and eventually the tapestry deepened._ | „

**???** are an alien entity that communicates with the [pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer") and [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA") within the game. They are a lifeform that has inhibited [MASSAGE-2 (AB)b](/wiki/Planet "Planet") since long before the events of the game. They are directly tied to [Mercer Spheres](/wiki/Mercer_Sphere "Mercer Sphere"), [Somersloops](/wiki/Somersloop "Somersloop") and [SAM](/wiki/SAM "SAM"). 

With the exception of the [SAM node ambience](/wiki/Story#SAM_nodes "Story"), ??? are fully subtitled. Once a message is received from ???, it can be freely viewed and replayed in the [Codex](/wiki/Codex "Codex").

## Attributes

???, just like [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA"), do not have a physical form. When they speak, the ADA logo in the subtitle box starts glitching. They appear to be some sort of inteligence, and reffer to themself as "We". 

Their voice is much similar to [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA"), with the differance that it's decently distorted and heavily reverbed. They communicate with the pioneer by tuning into their brainwaves. 

## Language

While ??? do speak in English, they use a heavily symbolic and metaphoric terms and syntax from different fields such as music, religion and anatomy. While it is hard to understand them, their language is not nonsense and has an informational value. 

While the language still hasn't been 100% decyphered, the following rules have been derived: 

  * Musical terms are used when describing communication. 
    * Examples: 
      * "Hear our song" => "Listen to us" / "Hear us out"
      * "Sing" => "Speak"
  * Anatomical terms are used to describe both the pioneers structures and parts of the ???. 
    * This implies that ??? are an ecosystem, comprised of Mercer Spheres, Somersloops and SAM.
    * Examples: 
      * "It covers the temple in bones and organs and limbs" => This describes the actions of the pioneer, as they construct factories on the planet. [Note: "temple" doesn't necesarily need to mean "planet". In context of other messages, it is actually more likely to describe a factory or a colony.]
  * "Knot" and "Tapestry" describe an interstelar network of ???, which implies that ??? are a multi-planetary colonial organism.



## Narrative

**Expand to reveal spoiler**

When performing specific actions, the player will hear [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA") speak, sometimes delivering a corrupted message in a different voice shown as ???. 

  * View [Story - MAM](/wiki/Story#MAM "Story") to read and hear individual messages, both normal (ADA) and corrupted (???), related to various research actions.
  * View [Story - Strange Communications](/wiki/Story#Strange_Communications "Story") to read and hear individual messages, both normal (ADA) and corrupted (???), related to collection of [Mercer Spheres](/wiki/Mercer_Sphere "Mercer Sphere") and [Somersloops](/wiki/Somersloop "Somersloop").
  * View [Story - SAM Nodes](/wiki/Story#SAM_nodes "Story") to read and hear individual messages, both normal (ADA) and corrupted (???), that will occur when the player is near a [SAM Resource Node](/wiki/SAM "SAM").



When ??? speak, the ADA logo will change to a shifting multi-colored logo.
