The **Alpha Hog** is the larger version of [Fluffy-tailed Hog](/wiki/Fluffy-tailed_Hog "Fluffy-tailed Hog") that is also considerably more dangerous, dealing up to 3x the [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage"). Other than its larger body size, it can be distinguished by the bright edges on the back of its carapace, and its tusks (which regular hogs lack). It also emits a shockwave-like particle effect when it prepares to attack. 

The Alpha Hog usually patrols around [Crash Sites](/wiki/Crash_Site "Crash Site"), [Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug") or [artifacts](/wiki/Artifacts "Artifacts").

## Behavior

Aggressive melee creature. It is hostile towards [pioneers](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer") and will charge at them. It will, however, ignore tractors (even with a player in them). If the Hog gets attacked while the player is standing on a platform out of reach of the Hog, it will flee. It has two attack patterns: A charge attack which deals 20 [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") each hit, and a bite attack that deals 30 damage. Be warned, its charge attack is more difficult to dodge than that of a normal Hog. It is advised to build a temporary [Ladder](/wiki/Ladder "Ladder") and shoot it with a [](/wiki/Rifle "Rifle") [Rifle](/wiki/Rifle "Rifle"). If it tries to escape, you can trap it with foundations and walls. 

### Spawning

Alpha Hogs usually spawn singularly, but may be accompanied by one or more regular [Fluffy-tailed Hogs](/wiki/Fluffy-tailed_Hog "Fluffy-tailed Hog"), and can be prevented from spawning by using [creature respawn prevention methods](/wiki/Creatures#Respawning "Creatures"). 

## Combat

The strategy applicable for normal hogs is not applicable for the Alpha Hog. The easiest way to kill an Alpha Hog with a melee weapon is: 

  * Before approaching it, build a [](/wiki/Stackable_Conveyor_Pole "Stackable Conveyor Pole") [Stackable Conveyor Pole](/wiki/Stackable_Conveyor_Pole "Stackable Conveyor Pole")/[](/wiki/Ladder "Ladder") [Ladder](/wiki/Ladder "Ladder") near it.
  * Rush to the ladder and climb up. It will come and chase you as you enter its vicinity.
  * As it stops nearby, build several [](/wiki/Conveyor_Splitter "Conveyor Splitter") [Conveyor Splitter](/wiki/Conveyor_Splitter "Conveyor Splitter")s to trap it. Ensure there is no gap left; you can safely overlap the splitters when you make the trap. 
    * This makes use of the fact that splitters don't encroach on each other.
  * Jump onto one of the Splitters using either the ladder or Crouch-jump, then use the [](/wiki/Xeno-Zapper "Xeno-Zapper") [Xeno-Zapper](/wiki/Xeno-Zapper "Xeno-Zapper") or [](/wiki/Xeno-Basher "Xeno-Basher") [Xeno-Basher](/wiki/Xeno-Basher "Xeno-Basher") to kill it.



All ranged weapons are also effective, even the [](/wiki/Rebar_Gun "Rebar Gun") [Rebar Gun](/wiki/Rebar_Gun "Rebar Gun"), which becomes available early on. Simply stand on a Foundation or terrain which the hog cannot reach.

### Damage

### Behavior

## Loot

1× [](/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack") [Jetpack](/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack")

There is a 1/1000 chance of any Alpha Hog spawner to spawn a special Hog variant equipped with a [](/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack") [Jetpack](/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack"). Some spawners are group spawners, if such one is chosen, all Alpha Hogs are replaced with Jetpack Hogs. 

The Jetpack Hog, named Johnny by developers,[1] appears like a regular [Fluffy-tailed Hog](/wiki/Fluffy-tailed_Hog "Fluffy-tailed Hog"), not an Alpha Hog (despite replacing one), and drops its Jetpack on death. It can spawn at any stage in the game, which allows a Jetpack to be obtained much sooner than from its usual [Tier 5](/wiki/Tier_5 "Tier 5") unlock, using [](/wiki/Solid_Biofuel "Solid Biofuel") [Solid Biofuel](/wiki/Solid_Biofuel "Solid Biofuel") to fuel it. 

### Behavior

The Jetpack Hog's idle animation is the same as the regular variant, but its attacks are completely unique: instead of a normal ground-based bull-rush, it will briefly pause to wind up its Jetpack and then launch into a spinning leap towards its target. It has a similar initiation range and target leading to the leap of a [Large Stinger](/wiki/Stinger "Stinger"). 

The Hog explodes on impact with any solid object or after a set period of time in the air, killing it and dealing enough damage to instantly kill the Pioneer even at full health with a direct hit, with significant splash damage. The sound cue for a Jetpack Hog launching is similar to the detonation of a [Nobelisk](/wiki/Nobelisk "Nobelisk"), but ends with a whooshing sound. 

The hog will not explode if killed before it can activate its Jetpack, and hit-stun will prevent it from starting its attack.

## Trivia

  * Johnny 'The Jetpack' Hog was coded by [Lym](https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Coffee_Stain_Studios?so=search#:~:text=Rasmus%20Knutsson%20%2D%20Programmer-,Tobias%20Carlsson,-%2D%20Programmer) after a meeting about creatures derailed into joking about Hogs being countered by Jetpacks.[3]
