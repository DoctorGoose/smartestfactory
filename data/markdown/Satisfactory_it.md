Satisfactory is a first-person open-world factory building game with a dash of exploration and combat. Play alone or with friends, explore an alien planet, create multi-story factories, and enter conveyor belt heaven! 

## Monetization

The game is a one-time purchase, and will not feature micro-transactions or loot boxes. There are plans to support the game post release, possibly with updates and/or DLC. It is unknown if these will be free or paid.[5]

On 5 August 2024, before the release of [1.0](/wiki/1.0 "1.0"), the price was increased from $29.99 to $39.99.[3] The reason given is inflation and development time spent since the original release.[6]

  * Satisfactory's name was hinted at in a 2017 tweet,[10] and later in a 2018 Q&A video.[11]
  * Satisfactory's pre-production started around 2016/2017.[12]
