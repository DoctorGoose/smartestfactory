## Introduction

Satisfactory is a factory-building game, centered around automation, exploration and expansion. Build a factory to automate the production of various resources required to progress through [Milestones](/wiki/Milestones "Milestones"), culminating in a fully-upgraded [](/wiki/Space_Elevator "Space Elevator") [Space Elevator](/wiki/Space_Elevator "Space Elevator") for Project Assembly. As each [Milestone](/wiki/Milestone "Milestone") tier is completed, more contents are unlocked. The requirements to unlock the next tier become increasingly complex and time-consuming to fulfill, thus it is advised to expand the factory to produce the required parts automatically and efficiently. 

The player-controlled game character, the [Pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer"), lands on an [alien planet named MASSAGE-2(A-B)b](/wiki/World "World") with only basic tools to build [](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB") [The HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB"). The game narrator, [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA"), provides guidance throughout [Tier 0](/wiki/Tier_0 "Tier 0"). [Tier 1](/wiki/Tier_1 "Tier 1") to [Tier 8](/wiki/Tier_8 "Tier 8") are left for the Pioneer to explore. Game content is mostly unlocked via Milestones and [Researches](/wiki/Research "Research"). Higher tiers of Milestones, in turn, are unlocked at the Space Elevator. Additional contents can be unlocked at the [](/wiki/AWESOME_Shop "AWESOME Shop") [AWESOME Shop](/wiki/AWESOME_Shop "AWESOME Shop"). 

There are [collectibles](/wiki/Collectibles "Collectibles") scattered around the World which can be collected to increase factory efficiency, such as [](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug") [Power Slug](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug")s and [](/wiki/Hard_Drive "Hard Drive") [Hard Drive](/wiki/Hard_Drive "Hard Drive")s. There are [hostile creatures](/wiki/Combat "Combat") guarding these resources, which makes [combat](/wiki/Combat "Combat") and [exploration](/wiki/Map "Map") part of the gameplay. 

  * Satisfactory is an open-ended game. As there is no actual 'Win' condition, players are not required to strictly follow this guide.
  * The writer of this article is left handed and is using custom keys. However, default control keys are referred in this guide.
  * The writer uses flying cheat to take the screenshots. Pioneer will be able to reach a higher elevation using [Ladder](/wiki/Ladder "Ladder") or [Jetpack](/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack").
  * **Spoilers warning** : If you wish to explore the game mechanics by yourself, stop reading now.
  * Disclaimer: This guide is written by community members and does not represent the 'Official Guide' in any way.

### Starting the game

  * From the main menu, click 'New Game -> 2nd area: Rocky Desert' 
    * All 4 starting areas are connected in the same [world](/wiki/World "World") and you are free to explore to the other areas in the game.
  * Enter session name
  * Choose Session Type: 
    * Private: For single-player Pioneer
    * Friends Only: For multiplayer. Officially supports up to 4 Pioneers
  * Skip Intro: Off. This actually skips the [Tier 0](/wiki/Tier_0 "Tier 0"). For first time Pioneer, going through Tier 0 is recommended.
  * Click 'Start Game'
  * Wait for the cinematic to end. The [Pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer"), the game character, will pick up the [Build Gun](/wiki/Build_Gun "Build Gun") and exit the [Drop-pod](/wiki/Drop-pod "Drop-pod"), where the game starts.
  * Move the mouse to look around, and find the rock pillar as shown in the below thumbnail. If it cannot be seen, restart the game until this rock pillar can be seen from landing location. It should be located South-West. Refer to the [Compass](/wiki/Compass "Compass") at the top of the screen. 
    * While in the Drop-pod, press [`Esc`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") and click the red 'Skip Intro' will skip the cinematic and Pioneer will land on ground. Tier 0 will not be skipped.
  * Once the rock pillar can be seen, while still near the Drop-pod, save the game. 
    * Press [`Esc`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), Save Game, then enter a name to save.
    * There are 3 autosaves that may be used to re-load in case the Pioneer died or encounter other accidents.

## Onboarding (Tier 0)

  * The game stage before [Tier 1](/wiki/Tier_1 "Tier 1") is called [Onboarding](/wiki/Onboarding "Onboarding"), where the game narrator [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA") will provide hints and guidance. 
    * Refer to the left of the screen for hints or instructions.
  * Use [`W`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")[`A`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")[`S`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")[`D`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to move. Use mouse [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_None.png "None") to look around.
  * At this stage, most of the [control keys](/wiki/Controls "Controls") are locked. More controls will be unlocked later. 
    * [Default keybindings](/wiki/Controls "Controls") will be referred in this guide. Custom-mapped controls will be shown at the bottom right.
  * Look at the [Drop-pod](/wiki/Drop-pod "Drop-pod") and dismantle [`F`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") it. Target(s) to be dismantled are highlighted in orange. Hold [`F`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to dismantle. After the drop-pod is dismantled, exit [`Esc`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") the dismantle mode. 
    * All dismantle actions refund the full cost of the buildable; no material is wasted. While dismantling, observe the materials that are being refunded.
    * If you moved too far from the drop pod, look at the [Compass](/wiki/Compass "Compass") above the screen to locate its direction.
  * Open the [Codex](/wiki/Codex "Codex") [`O`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). Explore its function and read through the pages.
  * Close [`Esc`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") the Codex window.
  * Open [Inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") [`Tab ↹`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). Drag the [](/wiki/Xeno-Zapper "Xeno-Zapper") [Xeno-Zapper](/wiki/Xeno-Zapper "Xeno-Zapper") to the 'Hands' slot at the right.
  * Try the following: 
    * Double-click the Xeno-Zapper in the hand slot to de-equip it.
    * Click 'Sort' at the bottom left to sort items.
    * Double-click the Xeno-Zapper in the inventory to equip it again.
    * At the right, Head, Body, Back and Legs equipments will be unlocked later, just ignore them now.
    * Near the bottom middle is the trash can. Items dragged to it will be deleted permanently. Do not use it now.
    * Drag the [](/wiki/HUB_Parts "HUB Parts") [HUB Parts](/wiki/HUB_Parts "HUB Parts") outside the inventory window to drop it onto the ground.
    * Item dropped to the ground will never respawn; there is no risk losing it.
  * Close [`Esc`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") the inventory. 
    * The in-game chat [`↵ Enter`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") function is now unlocked.
  * Pick up the HUB Parts [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). Make sure it is in the inventory. 
    * Items being picked up will be shown at lower left.
  * Holster [`H`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") the weapon. Press [`H`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") again to bring it out.
  * Open [Photo Mode](/wiki/Photo_Mode "Photo Mode") [`P`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), use mousewheel [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") to zoom in / out. Left click [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") to take a screenshot. Then close it [`P`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). 
    * Screenshots are located at `Documents\My Games\FactoryGame\Screenshots`
  * Learn the game's [Head-Up Display](/wiki/HUD "HUD"): 
    * At the lower left is the pioneer's [health](/wiki/Health "Health") bar. It has 100 HP, divided into 10 parts. Pioneer dies when HP reaches 0. Right above it is the equipped hand slot, the Xeno-Zapper.
    * At the top left is the current [game version](/wiki/Patch "Patch"). In a multiplayer session, all clients must be running the same version as the host.
    * At the top is the Compass. Look around and identify the E, W, N, S directions.
    * At the bottom right displays the keybindings for static key shortcuts.

### Movement controls

  * Press [`⇧ Shift`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to toggle run.
  * Try the following movements: 
    * Crouch [`C`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). Then, move around while crouching.
    * Jump vertically then crouch mid-air while pressing forward.
    * Slide. Run, then crouch.
    * While running forward, jump [`Space`](/wiki/Controls "Controls").
    * Slide-jump. Run forward [`W`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), then crouch, then immediately jump. Observe the jump is now further and higher.
    * Bunny-hop, a slide jump followed by another slide jump. This is slightly faster than running. Bunny hop will not work on uphill slopes.
    * Double zap. Spam attack key [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left"). Note that after every 2 attacks, there is a slight cooldown.
    * Try zap while running backwards. Try zap while jumping mid-air. Try bunny hop followed by immediate zap. Be familiar with these attack actions.
    * Perform [emote](/wiki/Emote "Emote"). Hold [`T`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") then choose one of the emote then release [`T`](/wiki/Controls "Controls").
    * Ping. Hold [`Alt`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") then click [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") on the ground. This also allows you to survey distance.
  * Look around and pick up [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") some [](/wiki/Beryl_Nut "Beryl Nut") [Beryl Nut](/wiki/Beryl_Nut "Beryl Nut"). They look like pistachio.
  * Try to eat 1 Beryl Nut. Open Inventory, equip the Nut into hand slot. Close the inventory. Left click [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") to consume 1 nut. A Nut heals 5 [HP](/wiki/Health "Health").
  * Equip back the Xeno-Zapper.
  * Move to the nearest wood until it is outlined white. Press and **Hold** [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), do not release it.
  * Move to other nearby woods to continue picking them up. 
    * [](/wiki/Wood "Wood") [Wood](/wiki/Wood "Wood"), [](/wiki/Leaves "Leaves") [Leaves](/wiki/Leaves "Leaves"), some other plants, and [Alien Remains](/wiki/Alien_Remains "Alien Remains") are collectively called [Biomass](/wiki/Biomass "Biomass") which can be used later for [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") productions.
  * Be ready to fight enemy aliens. Keep an eye on the HP bar.
  * Save the game.

### First encounter

  * Before moving towards the rock pillar as shown above, learn the following aliens and their attacks.
  * There are 3 types of hostile creatures at the moment. [Hogs](/wiki/Hog "Hog"), [Spitters](/wiki/Spitter "Spitter") and [Flying Crab Hatchers](/wiki/Flying_Crab_Hatcher "Flying Crab Hatcher").
  * [](/wiki/Fluffy-tailed_Hog "Fluffy-tailed Hog") [Hog](/wiki/Fluffy-tailed_Hog "Fluffy-tailed Hog"): Bumps to Pioneer to deal 10 damage. Move sideway or backwards and attack it. It takes 4 zaps to kill. Avoid dealing more than 2 hogs at once.
  * [](/wiki/Spitter "Spitter") [Spitter](/wiki/Spitter "Spitter"): Shoot at Pioneer to deal 3 damage. Just spam melee attacks at it. It takes 6 hits to kill.
  * [](/wiki/Flying_Crab_Hatcher "Flying Crab Hatcher") [Crab Hatcher](/wiki/Flying_Crab_Hatcher "Flying Crab Hatcher"): Spawn 3 [](/wiki/Flying_Crab "Flying Crab") [Flying Crab](/wiki/Flying_Crab "Flying Crab")s which suicide bombs at Pioneer, dealing 30 damages in total. It then spawn the next wave every 5 seconds. Ignore the crabs, bunny hop to the Hatcher and spam melee attacks. It takes 4 hits to kill. Avoid dealing more than 2 hatchers at once.
  * Other aliens, such as [](/wiki/Lizard_Doggo "Lizard Doggo") [Lizard Doggo](/wiki/Lizard_Doggo "Lizard Doggo"), [](/wiki/Space_Giraffe-Tick-Penguin-Whale_Thing "Space Giraffe-Tick-Penguin-Whale Thing") [Bean](/wiki/Space_Giraffe-Tick-Penguin-Whale_Thing "Space Giraffe-Tick-Penguin-Whale Thing") and [](/wiki/Non_Flying_Bird "Non Flying Bird") [Non Flying Bird](/wiki/Non_Flying_Bird "Non Flying Bird") are harmless.
  * After killing the alien, loot the drops, then keep them for later use.
  * Eat [Beryl Nuts](/wiki/Beryl_Nut "Beryl Nut") to heal. 
    * Even without eating, there is a high HP auto regen from 1~30 HP, and slow regen from 31~100 HP.
  * If the Pioneer died, reload the latest autosave.
  * Move towards the rock pillar while picking up [Woods](/wiki/Wood "Wood"), [Leaves](/wiki/Leaves "Leaves") and [Beryl Nuts](/wiki/Beryl_Nut "Beryl Nut"). 
    * Follow the path as shown below to reach the rock pillar.
    * Aim for 500-ish leaves, 200-ish woods and 30-ish nuts for a good start.
  * Once reaching the rock pillar, save the game.

### Mining Iron Ore and the HUB Upgrade 1

  * Scan [`V`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") for [](/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore") [Iron Ore](/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore") again. Observe the pinged locations, there are 6 Iron [nodes](/wiki/Resource_Node "Resource Node") nearby.
  * Check all the 6 Iron nodes. One of the Iron node is not clearly visible and can be ignored at this stage.
  * Approach the nearest Iron deposit, the rocky chunk above the Iron node. Hand mine (hold [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")) it and remove deposits above each nodes. Kill the guarding [](/wiki/Flying_Crab_Hatcher "Flying Crab Hatcher") [hatchers](/wiki/Flying_Crab_Hatcher "Flying Crab Hatcher"). 
    * After mining all 5 deposits, there should be around 100~130 Iron Ore in inventory.
  * Optional: look down at the Iron node. Mine it (Hold [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")) and observe 2 Iron Ores are added to inventory. 
    * This is considerably slower than mining the deposit. Stop hand-mining first.
  * [Flashlight](/wiki/Flashlight "Flashlight") is now unlocked [`B`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). Try turning it on and off.
  * Open build menu [`Q`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), click [](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB") [The HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB"), then build the HUB beside the rock pillar as shown. 
    * Use mousewheel [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") to rotate its direction. The 'balcony' side should be facing out.
    * If the HUB is built wrong, dismantle [`F`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") it then rebuild.
    * Only one HUB can be built in the world.
  * Stand in front of the HUB's terminal and open it [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls").
  * Observe the milestone cost and what it unlocks. Click 'Select Milestone'. The greyed-out icon shows it needs 10 [](/wiki/Iron_Rod "Iron Rod") [Iron Rod](/wiki/Iron_Rod "Iron Rod")s. Close it [`Esc`](/wiki/Controls "Controls").
  * Look behind, stand in front of the HUB's [](/wiki/Craft_Bench "Craft Bench") [Craft Bench](/wiki/Craft_Bench "Craft Bench") and open it [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). 
    * Explore its function, try clicking different buttons in it.
    * In multiplayer, build more Craft Bench on the ground, as each Craft Bench can only be occupied by a Pioneer. (Build menu -> Production -> Craft Bench)
  * Look at Iron Rod, it is greyed out. Point to the crafting requirement, observe 1 Iron Rod needs 1 [](/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot") [Iron Ingot](/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot") to make.
  * As 10 Iron Rods need 10 Iron Ingots, make 10 Ingots. Click Iron Ingot. Observe 1 Iron Ingot needs 1 Iron Ore to make.
  * Mouse over the yellow 'Hammer' button. To start crafting, hit [`Space`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") once. It will start crafting Ingots continuously. 
    * Observe the inventory items at the right. Ingots are added to the inventory while Ores are being consumed.
    * Optional: Turn all the Ores into Ingots. You may afk for 2 minutes during the crafting process.
  * After 10 Iron Ingots are made, hit [`Space`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") again to stop.
  * Craft 10 Iron Rods. Observe Iron Rods are made faster as each Rod requires 1 'Hammer', while Ingot requires 3 Hammers. 
    * Optional: Craft 50 Iron Rods and craft the remaining ingots into Iron Plates.
  * Open the HUB's terminal. Look at the top right 'Relevant Items', shows the Iron Rods.
  * Mouse over the Iron Rod icon, then [`Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") \+ [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") it, to transfer them to the terminal. 
    * Items transferred to the HUB's terminal cannot be taken back.
  * Click the yellow arrow 'Upgrade HUB'.
  * Open the terminal again, select 'HUB Upgrade 2', then 'Select Milestone'. 
    * The current Milestone requirement is displayed at the top right.
    * Do not rush for HUB upgrade 2. Use the materials to automate the mining process. Automation comes before progression.

### Portable Miner and the HUB Upgrade 2

  * After the Upgrade, observe the changes on The HUB.
  * A [Personal Storage Box](/wiki/Personal_Storage_Box "Personal Storage Box") is added beside the Terminal. Open the box. Organize the [Pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer")'s [Inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") and store unwanted items into it. 
    * Observe the dynamic shortcut keys displayed below the UI, such as transfer stack, split stack, etc.
    * If the box is full, excess items can be dropped to the ground, they will not disappear.
  * An upgraded HUB will not lose its progress even if it is dismantled then rebuilt elsewhere. Same holds true for [](/wiki/Space_Elevator "Space Elevator") [Space Elevator](/wiki/Space_Elevator "Space Elevator").
  * Make use of newly unlocked [](/wiki/Portable_Miner "Portable Miner") [Portable Miner](/wiki/Portable_Miner "Portable Miner") to semi-automate the mining process: 
    * First, build an [](/wiki/Equipment_Workshop "Equipment Workshop") [Equipment Workshop](/wiki/Equipment_Workshop "Equipment Workshop") near The HUB. Prepare necessary materials at the [Craft Bench](/wiki/Craft_Bench "Craft Bench").
    * Workout the necessary Iron Ingots required to make them. (13 Iron Ingots)
  * Find the Equipment Workshop in the build menu, under 'Production' tab. 
    * Alternatively, use the Search Box [`N`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). Type in 'Equipment Workshop', the result usually appears before you type its full name. Then click on it.
    * The Search Box can also be used as an arithmetic calculator; try it out.
  * If the Workshop's hologram intersects with the HUB, it will turn red, means it cannot be built there. Move the hologram away until it turns blue, then click to build. 
    * Recall any buildings can be dismantled [`F`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") for a full-refund.
  * Open the Equipment Workshop and craft 1 Portable Miner. 
    * Equipment Workshop and Craft Bench do not share functions; means Iron Rods and Plates cannot be crafted here. Go back to Craft Bench and craft some Iron Plates and Iron Rods.
  * Equip the Portable Miner into hand slot. 
    * Be careful as this will disarm the Xeno-Zapper. When facing aliens, quickly equip back the Xeno-Zapper.
  * Look at the nearest Iron node, place the Portable Miner down [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left"). Preferably close to the edge. 
    * When it shows 'Press and Hold [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to pick up Iron Ore', that is a valid place to put down a miner.
  * Open the Portable Miner [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") and click 'Grab All' to take out Iron Ores. 
    * Portable Miner will mine up to 1 stack of Iron Ore (100), then pause mining. Once the Ores are removed, it will continue mining.
    * The 'Pick Up Miner' will pick up both the Portable Miner and its contained Ores.
  * Craft more Iron Rods and Plates and complete the HUB Upgrade 2.
  * Optional: When looting biomass near around the base, intentionally left out one plant nearby each rock. This allows rocks and plants to be [Chainsawed](/wiki/Chainsaw "Chainsaw") out together later.

### Smelter and the HUB Upgrade 3

  * Making Iron Ingots manually is time-consuming. We will make use of [](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter") [Smelter](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter") to automate this process.
  * Smelter requires [](/wiki/Wire "Wire") [Wire](/wiki/Wire "Wire") which requires [](/wiki/Copper_Ore "Copper Ore") [Copper Ore](/wiki/Copper_Ore "Copper Ore") to make. Scan [`V`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") for Copper Ore. 
    * Hold [`V`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") and a selection wheel will pop out. Move the mouse towards 'Copper Ore' then release the [`V`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") key.
    * Use the [Compass](/wiki/Compass "Compass") to locate the search results. Save the game.
  * Find the two Copper nodes nearby and remove their deposits.
  * While moving towards the Copper node, some creepy voice can be heard. Just ignore these voices. 
    * This is related to some unfinished content, [Mercer Sphere](/wiki/Mercer_Sphere "Mercer Sphere") and [Somersloop](/wiki/Somersloop "Somersloop"). [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA") is urging the Pioneer to pick these up.
    * The one producing the voice is located above one of the rock pillar. Picking this up will silence the voices.
  * While walking around the base, pick up Leaves and Woods. You will need a lot of them.
  * Craft some Wires to build a Smelter. Craft more Wires and craft them into Cables.
  * When building a Smelter, observe it has a input port (orange) and output port (green). These are for conveyor belts and can be ignored at this stage.
  * Build a Power Line, which connects the HUB's Biomass Burner and the Smelter. Just build one Smelter now, as more can be built later.
  * Open the Smelter and select 'Iron Ingot' recipe. 
    * Alternatively, try type 'Iron Ingot' in the search bar to filter the desired recipe.
    * If clicked the wrong recipe, click the 'Select Recipe' tab at the top to re-select.
    * Observe the crafting speed and [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") consumption.

### Base Building - Foundations

  * Unlock [Tier 1](/wiki/Tier_1 "Tier 1") \- Base Building
  * Near Iron node with factory buildings, build a [](/wiki/Foundation_8m_x_4m "Foundation 8m x 4m") [Foundation 8m x 4m](/wiki/Foundation_8m_x_4m "Foundation 8m x 4m") on the ground while holding 'Snap To Guidelines' dynamic key [`Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). This will snap the first Foundation to the world grid.
  * Press 'Change Build Mode' dynamic key [`R`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") until it shows 'Vertical'. Then build a stack of foundations 5 blocks high above the first Foundation. 
    * When building, new Foundations will try to snap to the nearest nearby existing foundations.
  * Build a [](/wiki/Foundation_8m_x_1m "Foundation 8m x 1m") [Foundation 8m x 1m](/wiki/Foundation_8m_x_1m "Foundation 8m x 1m") beside the topmost foundation.
  * Use mass-dismantle to remove all the Foundation 4m.
  * Build a [Ladder](/wiki/Ladder "Ladder"), starting from the edge of the Foundation 1m, ends at the ground level. This allows Pioneer to climb up easily.
  * Climb above the foundation and build more Foundation 1m. Switch the build mode to 'Zoop' which allows building 10 Foundations along Z-X axes quickly.
  * Bring several [stacks](/wiki/Stack "Stack") of Concrete and Iron Plate, expand the foundation to roughly 20 x 10 tiles.
