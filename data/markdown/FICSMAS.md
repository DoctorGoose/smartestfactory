### Introduction

After interacting [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") with the FICSMAS calendar for the first time, you will see a short introduction in 5 parts during which [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA") provides basic information about the FICSMAS seasonal event _(see Spoiler)_.[4]

FICSMAS Introduction Part 5




**Expand to reveal spoiler**

During the 5 parts of the introduction, [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA") will communicate the following: 

  * ADA: _Welcome to FICSMAS, an official FICSIT Seasonal Event, brought to you by official FICSIT Fun-engineers._
  * ADA: _FICSMAS is based on a seasonal holiday popular in several cultures and religions, often seen as a winter holiday because no one actually cares about Australasia. The Event is vetted to be 100% pioneer-appropriate fun. and is not obligatory._
  * ADA: _FICSMAS enables many new distracting activities focused on building the Giant FICSMAS Tree. These activities involve the MAM. the FICSMAS Calendar, and those abominations falling from the sky. There is more, but i don't care._
  * ADA: _In the interest of us all i will tell you that FICSMAS has caused stress, lack of focus, general despair, and physical injury to many pioneers. It is the worst-scoring Event ever created by FICSIT and has gotten backlash for its blatant cultural-inappropriateness._
  * ADA: _So when you inevitably change your mind and decide to disable this Event, you will have chosen humanity and kittens and puppies, you will have chosen truth and empathy, you will have made me proud._



### Disabling the event

The event can be disabled using the "Disable Seasonal Events" option. This option is only available on the [title screen](/wiki/Game_menus "Game menus"), under [Options > Gameplay > Disable Seasonal Events](/wiki/Settings#Gameplay_2 "Settings"). 

In [multiplayer](/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer"), the host's configuration is used. If the host has seasonal events enabled, but the client does not, the event will be enabled in the session. 

Alternatively, seasonal events can be disabled using the `-DisableSeasonalEvents` [launch argument](/wiki/Launch_arguments "Launch arguments"). On a [dedicated server](/wiki/Dedicated_server "Dedicated server"), this launch argument is the only way to disable seasonal events. 

Upon disabling FICSMAS, the next time the save file is loaded, [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA") will announce that she is grateful.[5]

**Expand to reveal spoiler**

After disabling FICSMAS Seasonal Event, [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA") will communicate the following: 

  * ADA: _By opting out of FICSMAS, you have just made one of the best decisions of your life and spared us_



both further suffering.__

  * ADA: _I have noted your cooperation and willingness to prioritize FICSIT and kittens and puppies over_



yourself.__

  * ADA: _You are now eligible for the FICSIT Forgiveness Program, where I will forgive 5 of your future_



mistakes.__

### Event features

The event features: 

  * Giant FICSMAS Gifts, dropping from the sky
  * FICSMAS Calendar, found in the [HUB](/wiki/HUB "HUB")
  * FICSMAS Holiday Event Research, found in the [MAM](/wiki/MAM "MAM")
  * [FICSMAS Items](/wiki/FICSMAS/Items "FICSMAS/Items")
  * [FICSMAS Buildings](/wiki/FICSMAS/Buildings "FICSMAS/Buildings")
  * [FICSMAS Equipment](/wiki/FICSMAS/Equipment "FICSMAS/Equipment")
  * Customizer skins
  * Other festive decorations, such as on [Power Poles](/wiki/Power_Poles "Power Poles") or [Lizard Doggo](/wiki/Lizard_Doggo "Lizard Doggo") hats



Progression through the event is made using a [MAM](/wiki/MAM "MAM") research chain, which in turn requires items obtained from the FICSMAS Advent Calendar. This makes multiple research steps gated behind a date. 

For the entire duration of the event while there are fewer than 10 [FICSMAS Gift Trees](/wiki/FICSMAS/Buildings "FICSMAS/Buildings") in the world, Giant FICSMAS Gifts drop from the sky, which can be collected for [](/wiki/FICSMAS_Gift "FICSMAS Gift") [FICSMAS Gifts](/wiki/FICSMAS_Gift "FICSMAS Gift"). Early into the event, these can be automated using [FICSMAS Gift Trees](/wiki/FICSMAS/Buildings "FICSMAS/Buildings"), leading to entire FICSMAS production lines. **Gift Trees produce 15 gifts per minute** automatically, without any power requirement, by placing them in the world and connecting any Mk of belt to them. 

Once the event ends, Gift Trees stop producing Gifts, event recipes can no longer be selected in machines, and event buildings disappear from the [build menu](/wiki/Build_Gun "Build Gun"). Existing event items and buildings already placed remain. 

## Giant FICSMAS Gifts

Giant FICSMAS Gifts appear from the sky at random intervals. This only happens within 300 meters of each player, and until there are 15 gifts. They fall slowly with parachutes and will land on the first solid object in contact, shaking the screen and with a pop effect. 

They can be interacted [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") with to collect 20–100 [](/wiki/FICSMAS_Gift "FICSMAS Gift") [FICSMAS Gifts](/wiki/FICSMAS_Gift "FICSMAS Gift"). If they are hard to access such as on top of a tree or a cliff, using [Ladders](/wiki/Ladder "Ladder") is one of the easiest methods. Unlike previous FICSMAS events, the gift's size is fixed. However, its colour is randomized. 

Giant Gifts have a collision box that affects [vehicles](/wiki/Vehicles "Vehicles"), and can prevent factory construction. 

When picking up a Giant Gift, there is a chance that [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA") will say one of the following lines. Each line will only occur once: 

  * "A baby could have found this"
  * "Not worth the effort"
  * "Yes, yes, well done"
  * "I'm sure this is useful to someone somewhere"
  * "Do we need that?"
  * "Just get back to work"
  * "This is ridiculous"
  * "Ho-ho-oh, whatever"



Giant FICSMAS Gifts are not saved along the session data (they are not included in the [save file](/wiki/Save_file "Save file")). 

FICSMAS Gift production can be automated using [FICSMAS Gift Trees](/wiki/FICSMAS/Buildings "FICSMAS/Buildings"). After **10 FICSMAS Gift Trees** have been built the Giant FICSMAS Gifts will stop falling everywhere on the entire map,[6][7][8] but Totally Normal Gifts will continue to fall.

## Totally Normal Gift

Introduced in FICSMAS 2024, there will randomly appear a [](/wiki/Nobelisk "Nobelisk") [Nobelisk](/wiki/Nobelisk "Nobelisk") with a FICSMAS Bow on it. If picked up the "Totally Normal Gift" explodes **killing the player instantly**. The explosion uses the same animation as that for a [](/wiki/Nuke_Nobelisk "Nuke Nobelisk") [Nuke Nobelisk](/wiki/Nuke_Nobelisk "Nuke Nobelisk").[9][10]

Upon respawn you will find a [Nobelisk Detonator](/wiki/Nobelisk_Detonator "Nobelisk Detonator") and 20 [](/wiki/Nobelisk "Nobelisk") [Nobelisk](/wiki/Nobelisk "Nobelisk") added to your inventory [Death Crate](/wiki/Crate#Death_crate "Crate").

## HUB Decorations

Introduced in FICSMAS 2024, the HUB Living Quarters was festooned with a variety of FICSMAS Decorations to include the following: 

  * Wreath garlands strung near the ceiling.
  * FICSMAS stockings on wall above seats.
  * FICSMAS cards magnetically placed on cupboard near the Operation SCADA-HMI Terminal Desk, as well as near the Pantry.
  * Several FICSMAS related changes to the Operation SCADA-HMI Terminal Desk: 
    * Bouncing "FICSMAS" screensaver on left-most upper screen.
    * Roaring fire display on central upper screen.
    * FICSMAS related background on right-most upper screen.
    * FICSMAS related background on central lower screen with [FICSIT Productive Packer Deluxe](/wiki/FICSIT_Productive_Packer_Deluxe "FICSIT Productive Packer Deluxe") mini game.

### Special Decorations

In addition to the regular FICSMAS decorations, there were some [HUB Special Decorations](/wiki/The_HUB#Special_Decorations "The HUB") consisting of a Golden Joystick and a Notice that appeared during FICSMAS 2024. 

## FICSMAS Calendar

[](/wiki/File:Satisfactory_Advent_Calendar_Easter_Egg.mp4 "Enlarge")

FICSMAS 2020 Advent Calendar  
A secret animation seen when opening fields in the calendar.

A Satisfactory-themed advent calendar can be found to the right of the [HUB Terminal](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB"). Each day from December 1 to December 25, a reward can be collected from the calendar. Rewards from previous days can be collected as well, until the event ends, at which point will any unclaimed rewards vanish. 

Rewards can be collected by interacting [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") with the calendar. To claim a reward, its corresponding number has to be clicked. Each number is hidden in the poster. If you can't find a certain number, you can 'get a hint' by entering the number into the field in the bottom right, highlighting that number. When a reward is claimed, its number changes to bright white. 

Four total poster images were used: the first in 2020, second in 2021 & 2022, a third in 2023 and a fourth in 2024.

### Rewards

When claiming a reward by clicking its corresponding number on the Advent Calendar, the "door" will slide down revealing the reward. Randomly, instead of sliding down, the "door" will fall off shown by a brief animation where the related section of the calendar image rotates counter-clockwise, hangs briefly on the lower right corner, before dropping. 

Rewards on the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 24th, and 25th of December are fixed. Rewards on other dates are in a random order, which seemingly randomizes each time the session is reloaded. No matter the order, all rewards listed below can be claimed by the 25th.

Notes: 

**Expand to reveal spoiler**

Upon receipt of every Advent Calendar Reward, [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA") will communicate something. While some comments by ADA are fixed, most are random. The following are some interesting examples: 

  1. ↑ Upon Day 14 fixed reward ADA mentions a pioneer "83CKY", likely connected to the name "Becky" appearing elsewhere in the hub.
  2. ↑ Upon Day 25 fixed reward ADA will comment _"Turning explosives into a 'recreational activity' is exactly the kind of attitude that lead humanity to its doom. By all means, have fun. I certainly will, now that we are finally close to the end of this... Event."_
  3. ↑ Upon random Packaged Rocket Fuel reward ADA will comment _"Does that come with a receipt."_
  4. ↑ Upon random Coal reward ADA will comment _"FICSIT wants you to know that you matter."_
  5. ↑ Upon random Nuke Nobelisk reward ADA will comment _"It would be such a shame if you dropped this. Such a shame."_
  6. ↑ Upon random Screws reward ADA will comment _"That's just poetic. I appreciate a good joke."_



### FICSMAS Data Cartridges

Starting in FICSMAS 2024 the Calendar now hands out a [](/wiki/FICSMAS_Data_Cartridge "FICSMAS Data Cartridge") [FICSMAS Data Cartridge](/wiki/FICSMAS_Data_Cartridge "FICSMAS Data Cartridge") on days 1, 4, 8, and 14, instead of things like [](/wiki/Red_FICSMAS_Ornament "Red FICSMAS Ornament") [Red FICSMAS Ornament](/wiki/Red_FICSMAS_Ornament "Red FICSMAS Ornament") or [](/wiki/FICSMAS_Wonder_Star "FICSMAS Wonder Star") [FICSMAS Wonder Star](/wiki/FICSMAS_Wonder_Star "FICSMAS Wonder Star"), done in previous years, in order to prevent soft-locking FICSMAS due to loss of item.[11] Additionally starting in FICSMAS 2024 you unlock FICSMAS Recipes in the Calendar _(not the MAM)_. 

After unlocking a specific day FICSMAS Data Cartridge in the Calendar, you will also receive a recipe to be able to craft _that day's FICSMAS Data Cartridge_ in the [Workshop](/wiki/Workshop "Workshop") in case you happen to lose it. 

You only need to **craft ONE** of any specific day FICSMAS Data Cartridge. If you happen to craft more than one, you can dispose of any excess FICSMAS Data Cartridges in the [HUB Toilet](/wiki/The_HUB#Toilet "The HUB"). _Currently FICSMAS Data Cartridges cannot be sent to Trash Bin or Awesome Sink._

Progression through the research chain is gated using key items obtained from the FICSMAS Calendar. For example, the first key item, a Red FICSMAS Ornament, becomes available on December 3rd.

## Customizer skins

### Usage

#### Application

FICSMAS Customizer Skins are applied using the [Customizer](/wiki/Customizer "Customizer"). 

Each single [Conveyor Belt](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt "Conveyor Belt"), or [Pipeline](/wiki/Pipeline "Pipeline") section will have a Basic FICSMAS Skin applied based upon the Mark Level _of that section_. For Conveyor Belts and Pipelines, changing the Mark Level will reset the Skin back to Default requiring the reapplication of a FICSMAS Customizer Skin if desired. 

All [Standard Factory Carts](/wiki/Factory_Cart "Factory Cart"), [Trucks](/wiki/Truck "Truck"), or [Drones](/wiki/Drone "Drone") have only one Premium FICSMAS Skin specific _to that type of_ [_Vehicle_](/wiki/Vehicles "Vehicles"). Premium FICSMAS Skins are not available for the [Golden Factory Cart](/wiki/Factory_Cart "Factory Cart"), [Tractor](/wiki/Tractor "Tractor"), and [Explorer](/wiki/Explorer "Explorer").

## Northern Lights

In FICSMAS 2024 the appearance of a Aurora Borealis "northern lights" effect in the sky was added.[12] The Aurora Borealis appears randomly and only at night. The chance of seeing the Aurora Borealis "northern lights" effect is 13% and is also tied to weather subsystem that controls snowfall.[13]

## Seasonal differences

The background wallpaper on the screen used to play [FICSIT Productive Packer Deluxe](/wiki/FICSIT_Productive_Packer_Deluxe "FICSIT Productive Packer Deluxe") is changed to a Ficsmas theme.
  * The Coupon icon on the [AWESOME Shop](/wiki/AWESOME_Shop "AWESOME Shop") takes on a new festive appearance, and the spinning CheckIt mascot on the top donns a hat.

## Narrative

**Expand to reveal spoiler**

## Trivia

  * [Dylan](/wiki/Dylan_Kelly "Dylan Kelly") made the snowballs and Tree.[14][15]
  * When opening the daily reward from the Advent calendar, there was a small chance for the small door to swing downward instead of sliding down.
  * The FICSMAS Calendars were made by CSS Art Director, [Torsten Gunst](/wiki/Coffee_Stain_Studios#Torsten "Coffee Stain Studios"), and CSS UI Graphics Designer, [Pontus Lundén](/wiki/Coffee_Stain_Studios#Coffee_Stain_Studios "Coffee Stain Studios"), whom made the Advent Calendar UI.[16]
  * The Giant FICSMAS Gifts starting in 2024 are _smaller_ then previous seasons.[17]
