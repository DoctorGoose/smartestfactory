This page serves as a **how to play guide / walkthrough for _[Satisfactory](/wiki/Satisfactory "Satisfactory")_**. 

## Overview

Satisfactory is a factory-building game, centered around expansion, exploration, and automation. Build a factory to automate the production of various resources required to progress through [Milestones](/wiki/Milestones "Milestones"), culminating in a fully-upgraded [Space Elevator](/wiki/Space_Elevator "Space Elevator") for Project Assembly. As each Milestone tier is completed, more game content is unlocked. The requirements for the next tier become increasingly complex and time-consuming to fulfill, so it is advised to expand the factory to produce the required parts automatically and efficiently. 

The player-controlled game character, the [pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer"), lands on an [alien planet named MASSAGE-2(A-B)b](/wiki/World "World") with only basic tools to build [The HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB"). The game narrator, [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA"), provides guidance throughout [Tier 0](/wiki/Tier_0 "Tier 0") while [Tier 1](/wiki/Tier_1 "Tier 1") to [Tier 9](/wiki/Milestones "Milestones") are left for the player to explore. Game content is mostly unlocked via [Milestones](/wiki/Milestones "Milestones") and [Research](/wiki/Research "Research"). Higher tiers of [Milestones](/wiki/Milestones "Milestones"), in turn, are unlocked at the [Space Elevator](/wiki/Space_Elevator "Space Elevator"). Additional content is unlocked at the [AWESOME Shop](/wiki/AWESOME_Shop "AWESOME Shop"). 

There are collectibles scattered around the [World](/wiki/World "World") which can be used to increase factory efficiency. These items include [](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug") [Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug"), [](/wiki/Hard_Drive "Hard Drive") [Hard Drives](/wiki/Hard_Drive "Hard Drive"), [](/wiki/Mercer_Sphere "Mercer Sphere") [Mercer Spheres](/wiki/Mercer_Sphere "Mercer Sphere") and [](/wiki/Somersloop "Somersloop") [Somersloops](/wiki/Somersloop "Somersloop"). There are [hostile creatures](/wiki/Creatures#Hostile "Creatures") guarding these resources. [Combat](/wiki/Combat "Combat") and exploration are also key part of the gameplay. 

# Guide

Satisfactory has an ending, which is the completion of Phase 5. This guide will highlight how to complete all phases and tiers. 

**_Spoiler Warning:_ If you wish to explore the game mechanics by yourself, stop reading now.**

  


_Disclaimer:_ This guide is written by community members and does not represent the 'Official Guide' in any way.

  


## Game start

### Main menu

  * At the [main menu](/wiki/Game_menus "Game menus"), review the [controls](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), video, and audio settings. Adjust where necessary. 
    * Recommendations: 
      * Tick 'Enable Directional Subtitles', which allows easier detection of [hostile creatures](/wiki/Combat "Combat").
      * For continuous running without holding down [`⇧ Shift`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), un-tick 'Hold to sprint'.
  * Start a New Game.
  * Pick one of the four starting areas. They are all connected in the same [world](/wiki/World "World"). 
    * For this guide, select the 2nd - Rocky Desert.
    * Other than the visual differences between the [biomes](/wiki/Biomes "Biomes"), all of the starting areas have about the same gameplay difficulty. There is enough foliage even in the Dune Desert to last until sustainable power becomes available.
  * Enter the session name. Tick 'Friends Only' for hosting a multiplayer session or leave it as 'Private' for a single player.
  * You are advised not to tick 'Skip Intro' at the bottom right. 
    * Tick only when you are already familiar with the early game. Skipping the intro can save about 30 mins ~ one hour of gameplay time.
  * An intro movie will play. Wait for it to end. 
    * It can be skipped by pressing [`Esc`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") and clicking 'SKIP INTRO'.


  * [](/wiki/File:Session_starting.png "The screen where a new session is initiated.")

The screen where a new session is initiated.




### Before moving

  * In the cutscene, the [pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer") (the game character) picks up the [Build Gun](/wiki/Build_Gun "Build Gun") and walks out of the [drop-pod](/wiki/Drop-pod "Drop-pod").
  * At first, most of the [control keys](/wiki/Controls "Controls") are locked. As we progress, these functions will be unlocked progressively. 
    * Use [`W`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")[`A`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")[`S`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")[`D`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to move. Use the mouse to look around.
  * The game narrator, [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA"), will advise you about each objective. Pressing [`↵ Enter`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") will skip her narrations. 
    * Avoid skipping ADA's narrations during your first playthrough.
  * Look at the game's [Head-Up Display](/wiki/HUD "HUD"): 
    * At the bottom right are the shortcut keys; they are updated according to the current keybindings. 
      * In this guide, the [default keybindings](/wiki/Controls "Controls") will be referenced.
    * At the lower left is the pioneer's [health](/wiki/Health "Health") bar. You have 100 HP, divided into 10 segments. 
      * We will soon encounter our first [combat](/wiki/Combat "Combat") so keep an eye on it.
    * At the top left is the current [game version](/wiki/Patch "Patch"). 
      * For a multiplayer session, all clients must be running the same game version as the host to be able to join the game.
    * At the middle left is the current objective recommended by ADA.
    * At the top is the [compass](/wiki/Compass "Compass"). 
      * A [Map](/wiki/Map "Map") is not currently available but will be unlocked later.
      * Look around with the mouse. The direction of the drop-pod is indicated on the compass.
  * Press [`F`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to enter dismantle mode: 
    * Aim at the drop-pod until it is highlighted in orange. This means it is targeted to be dismantled.
    * At the center of the screen you will see the resources that will be returned to you when you dismantle the target. Usually, this will be equal to the building cost. 
      * All [buildings](/wiki/Buildings "Buildings") are 100% refundable.
    * Below the center of the screen is a list of additional control keys. 
      * Hold down [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") while aiming at a building to dismantle it.
      * Hold [`Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to select multiple buildings to dismantle at the same time.
      * Press [`Esc`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") or [`Q`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") or [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right") to cancel dismantle.
    * While dismantle mode is active, the edge of the screen blinks red.
  * After the drop-pod is dismantled, the [HUB Parts](/wiki/HUB_Parts "HUB Parts") item is added to the pioneer's inventory.
  * ADA will advise you to open the [Codex](/wiki/Codex "Codex"), the in-game encyclopedia. 
    * Open the Codex [`O`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") and have a look at it. Close it with the 'X' at the top right or by pressing [`Esc`](/wiki/Controls "Controls").
  * ADA will advise you to equip the [Xeno-Zapper](/wiki/Xeno-Zapper "Xeno-Zapper").
  * Open the [inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") [`Tab ↹`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") and observe: 
    * There are two items in your inventory slots: the HUB Parts, and the [Xeno-Zapper](/wiki/Xeno-Zapper "Xeno-Zapper"), the starter melee weapon. 
      * 16 inventory slots are available at the beginning. Additional slots can be unlocked later.
    * At the bottom left is the sort button.
    * At the bottom middle is the trash slot. Dragging items into it will delete the item permanently. Do not use it now.
    * At the right is the character equipment slot. 
      * one body slot and one hand slot are available at the start.
      * Additional hand slots can be unlocked later. The body slot, however, is limited to one only.
    * [`⇧ Shift`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")+[](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") the Xeno-Zapper to equip it. Alternatively, you can double-click it or drag it to the hand slot.
  * Click and drag the 20 Iron Ore to the outside the inventory window to drop it onto the ground. 
    * Dropped items will never de-spawn. This is useful when running out of inventory space or when transferring items in multiplayer.
    * Close the inventory window [`Esc`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") or click at the 'X' at the top right.
  * Pick up the HUB Parts by looking at it and interacting [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). 
    * It displays '+1 HUB Parts (1)'. The +1 represents the quantity of this item obtained in the recent past.
    * The number in the parentheses () indicates the quantity of this item in the inventory.


  * [](/wiki/File:Early_game_HUD.png "Dismantling the Drop-pod returns one HUB Parts. Various HUD components are labelled in the image.")

Dismantling the [Drop-pod](/wiki/Drop-pod "Drop-pod") returns one [HUB Parts](/wiki/HUB_Parts "HUB Parts"). Various [HUD](/wiki/HUD "HUD") components are labelled in the image.

  * [](/wiki/File:HUB_parts_dropped.png "Learning the interaction of inventory: Drag-and-drop to equip an item; drag-and-drop the item outside drops the item onto the floor.")

Learning the interaction of inventory: Drag-and-drop to equip an item; drag-and-drop the item outside drops the item onto the floor.




### Loot for thought

  * This section is only for more experienced players. **If this is your first time playing Satisfactory, skip this section** to avoid getting yourself injured.
  * Remember high risk, high rewards.
  * Pick up plenty of [](/wiki/Beryl_Nut "Beryl Nut") [Beryl Nut](/wiki/Beryl_Nut "Beryl Nut") for healing.
  * For biomass, prioritize picking up [Wood](/wiki/Wood "Wood") over [Leaves](/wiki/Leaves "Leaves") since it can be converted into more [Biomass](/wiki/Biomass "Biomass").
  * Instead of going for [Iron Ore](/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore"), visit the marked [Crash Sites](/wiki/Crash_Site "Crash Site") in the image below and pick up [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") their loot. 
    * You won't have the in-game [Map](/wiki/Map "Map") unlocked at the current moment. Use only the [compass](/wiki/Compass "Compass") and terrain features to orientate yourself.
    * The [Lizard Doggo](/wiki/Lizard_Doggo "Lizard Doggo") cave east of Oil [Islands](/wiki/Islands "Islands") has plenty of loot-able items on the cave floor.
    * Visiting other Crash Sites is not advised as they are guarded by Alpha creatures which can be difficult to kill with only the [Xeno-Zapper](/wiki/Xeno-Zapper "Xeno-Zapper"), but not impossible if you can manage to stay under their hitboxes.
    * Unlock one of the Crash Sites with nine [Modular Frames](/wiki/Modular_Frame "Modular Frame") and keep the [Hard Drive](/wiki/Hard_Drive "Hard Drive") for [researching](/wiki/Research "Research") [Alternate Recipes](/wiki/Alternate_Recipes "Alternate Recipes") later. Prioritize [Casted Screw](/wiki/Screw "Screw"), then save the rest for after you unlock [Tier 5](/wiki/Tier_5 "Tier 5") \- Alternative Fluid Transport.
  * At the end of the trip, you should have: 
    * [](/wiki/Wire "Wire") [Wire](/wiki/Wire "Wire"): 552
    * [](/wiki/Cable "Cable") [Cable](/wiki/Cable "Cable"): 144
    * [](/wiki/Screws "Screws") [Screws](/wiki/Screws "Screws"): 1056
    * [](/wiki/Reinforced_Iron_Plate "Reinforced Iron Plate") [Reinforced Iron Plate](/wiki/Reinforced_Iron_Plate "Reinforced Iron Plate"): 57
    * [](/wiki/Modular_Frame "Modular Frame") [Modular Frame](/wiki/Modular_Frame "Modular Frame"): 40
    * [](/wiki/Encased_Industrial_Beam "Encased Industrial Beam") [Encased Industrial Beam](/wiki/Encased_Industrial_Beam "Encased Industrial Beam"): 114
    * [](/wiki/Heavy_Modular_Frame "Heavy Modular Frame") [Heavy Modular Frame](/wiki/Heavy_Modular_Frame "Heavy Modular Frame"): 12
    * [](/wiki/Motor "Motor") [Motor](/wiki/Motor "Motor"): 30
    * [](/wiki/Circuit_Board "Circuit Board") [Circuit Board](/wiki/Circuit_Board "Circuit Board"): 15
    * [](/wiki/Computer "Computer") [Computer](/wiki/Computer "Computer"): 30
    * [](/wiki/Heat_Sink "Heat Sink") [Heat Sink](/wiki/Heat_Sink "Heat Sink"): 7
  * Use the above items to rush for Coal Power. It is feasible to have the 600 MW Coal Power up and running before two hours.[1]
  * Unlock [Tier 2](/wiki/Tier_2 "Tier 2") \- Resource Sink Bonus Program first.
  * Put the higher tier items into the [AWESOME Sink](/wiki/AWESOME_Sink "AWESOME Sink") and purchase [Rotors](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor"), [Reinforced Iron Plates](/wiki/RIP "RIP") and [Copper Sheets](/wiki/Copper_Sheet "Copper Sheet") for bootstrapping the Coal Power.
  * Produce 50 [Smart Platings](/wiki/Smart_Plating "Smart Plating") ASAP with at least four [Assemblers](/wiki/Assembler "Assembler").


  * [](/wiki/File:Rocky_Desert_loot.png "Visit the marked Crash Sites and pick up the loots.")

Visit the marked [Crash Sites](/wiki/Crash_Site "Crash Site") and pick up the loots.




### First Iron Ore

  * Look for [Iron Ore](/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore").
  * As we will soon face the dangers, first use the ESC menu to save the game. 
    * Autosaves are created at 5-minute intervals, and the last three autosaves will be kept in case you need to reload after a death or serious mistake. The interval can be adjusted in 'Options'.
    * If you die, you can press ESC and reload the last save.
    * Alternatively, click [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") to respawn. The pioneer respawns in the [HUB](/wiki/HUB "HUB") or starting area with 30% health, and all items are left back at the point of death (or the last solid ground if you fell into the Void) inside a [Crate](/wiki/Crate "Crate").
    * In multiplayer, pioneers can revive each other by interacting [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") with the dead player.
    * If the pioneer gets stuck, such as on a tree, you can force-kill the pioneer by clicking 'RESPAWN' in the Esc menu.
    * There is no limit on how many times can the pioneer be killed as there is no Game Over in this game.
  * Use the [Resource Scanner](/wiki/Resource_Scanner "Resource Scanner"): Hold down [`V`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") then release it to scan for [Iron Ore](/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore"). 
    * A blue sphere propagates outwards, and three pings can be heard. The [Resource Scanner](/wiki/Resource_Scanner "Resource Scanner") always indicates the three nearest [resource patches](/wiki/Resource_Node "Resource Node") of the selected type. 
      * 'Ore' refers to the type of resource produced.
      * 'Node' refers to the disc-shaped terrain feature that produces unlimited amounts of the resource.
      * 'Deposit' refers to a rocky outcrop that provides a limited amount of a resource. Deposits can only be mined manually [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls").
      * 'Patch' refers to a group of similar Resource Nodes.
    * Their directions and distances are indicated on the [compass](/wiki/Compass "Compass") after scanning.
  * Ignore all the three results shown. Instead, move **northeast** about 450 meters, until you see a river. Then, scan again for Iron Ore.
  * Move towards the Iron patch located in the northeast direction. 
    * Use [`⇧ Shift`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to toggle between run and walk.
    * Run is faster, however, it scares [Lizard Doggos](/wiki/Lizard_Doggo "Lizard Doggo") away. Remember not to run when taming them in the later game.
    * Use [`Space`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to jump and [`C`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to crouch.
    * Crouch before jumping for a higher and longer jump. Crouch while running downhill to perform a slide.
    * Later on there is a piece of equipment that improves the pioneer's mobility.
  * Bunny-hopping is slightly faster than normal running. Hold down [`C`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") and tap the [`Space`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") when the character returns to the ground.
  * To find the location in the image, first look for the small river that divides the desert, then follow the river upstream to the east. 
    * When you meet several poisonous [Spore Flowers](/wiki/Spore_Flower "Spore Flower") in the middle of the river, move north and you will reach the destination.
  * There are plenty of [leaves](/wiki/Leaves "Leaves") and [branches](/wiki/Wood "Wood") on the ground; pick them up [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") while moving. 
    * They are needed in large quantities to produce [power](/wiki/Power "Power") for the factory.
    * Generally, pick up anything that you come across. For example, the [](/wiki/Beryl_Nut "Beryl Nut") [Beryl Nut](/wiki/Beryl_Nut "Beryl Nut")s, which is a type of healing item.
  * Before reaching the destination, one of the following [hostile creatures](/wiki/Combat "Combat") may be encountered: 
    * [](/wiki/Fluffy-tailed_Hog "Fluffy-tailed Hog") [Fluffy-tailed Hog](/wiki/Fluffy-tailed_Hog "Fluffy-tailed Hog"), [](/wiki/Spitter "Spitter") [Spitter](/wiki/Spitter "Spitter") or [](/wiki/Flying_Crab "Flying Crab") [Flying Crab](/wiki/Flying_Crab "Flying Crab"): Read their pages to learn how to defeat them.
    * [](/wiki/Alpha_Hog "Alpha Hog") [Alpha Hog](/wiki/Alpha_Hog "Alpha Hog") or [](/wiki/Alpha_Spitter "Alpha Spitter") [Alpha Spitter](/wiki/Alpha_Spitter "Alpha Spitter"): We are not ready to fight these yet. If one notices you, run away until it resets back to its spawn location and avoid passing through the same area.
  * Use the [Resource Scanner](/wiki/Resource_Scanner "Resource Scanner") [`V`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to pinpoint this location as shown below:


  * [](/wiki/File:Online_map_Rocky_Desert_tutorial.png "Scan for Iron Ore and move to North East until you see three Iron nodes. The tallest rock spire will show you the direction. The Map in-game can be unlocked later on.")

Scan for Iron Ore and move to North East until you see three Iron nodes. The tallest rock spire will show you the direction. The [Map](/wiki/Map "Map") in-game can be unlocked later on.

  * [](/wiki/File:Rocky_Desert_Start_Area.png "Move around and look for the highest rock pillar in the area at the northeast. Follow the river upstream.")

Move around and look for the highest rock pillar in the area at the northeast. Follow the river upstream.

  * [](/wiki/File:Rocky_Desert_river_split.png "At the river split, turn left and move to the target base location.")

At the river split, turn left and move to the target base location.

  * [](/wiki/File:Rocky_Desert_Base.png "Find the area with three iron ore nodes on it as shown here. We will build the HUB a little bit right of it.")

Find the area with three iron ore nodes on it as shown here. We will build the HUB a little bit right of it.

  * [](/wiki/File:Rocky_Desert_three_iron_nodes.png "After the hog is killed, we can mine these Iron nodes safely.")

After the hog is killed, we can mine these Iron nodes safely.



  * There are three Iron nodes on the rocky steps in the 2nd image. We will reserve the space in front of them for factory buildings. We will build [The HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB") just a little bit right of the steps.
  * The build menu is currently locked until the first [Iron Ore](/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore") is mined.
  * Move towards the Iron patch and prepare for combat. 
    * Read [Hog](/wiki/Hog "Hog") to learn how to kill it.
  * Scan [`V`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") for Iron Ore again.
  * Each Iron node is marked with a bright circle. The rocky part on top of that is a resource [deposit](/wiki/Deposit "Deposit"), which must be manually mined out before a [miner](/wiki/Miner "Miner") can be built on the node. 
    * [Portable Miners](/wiki/Portable_Miner "Portable Miner") are not blocked by these Resource Deposits.
  * Approach the Resource Deposit and hold [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") while looking at it to start mining. Deposits can yield anywhere from a couple of dozen to a hundred of the resource. 
    * All Resource Deposits are considered 'pure'. They quickly run out when mined and never regenerate.
    * Repeat until all three Iron deposits are mined out (once the rocky 'tips' have disappeared).
  * To continue mining, aim at the Iron node (the flat disk-shaped thing just below the iron deposit) and press [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). This however mines at a much slower rate. 
    * All Resource Nodes are infinite. _Continue reading:[Resource Node](/wiki/Resource_Node "Resource Node")._
    * The center of the screen indicates that the Iron Ore node is 'normal'. This is the node [purity](/wiki/Purity "Purity") that affects mining speed.
  * Mine about 80 Iron Ore.



### Building the HUB

  * Build [The HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB") below and to the east of the rocky stage.
  * In the build menu [`Q`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), click on 'The HUB' to select its hologram. Aim at a flat area of ground. Use the [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") wheel to rotate it. [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") again to confirm the build. 
    * At the center is the building cost. It displays '20 Iron Ore
    * As there is a limit on the hub, you can only build one [HUB](/wiki/HUB "HUB") in a game.
    * If you attempt to build more than one HUB, it displays 'Can't Afford! You can only build one!'
  * The HUB - framing is built. We can now work toward completing the HUB.



## Tier 0

### HUB Upgrade 1

  * At the center of [The HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB") is a [Craft Bench](/wiki/Craft_Bench "Craft Bench"). Interact [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to use it. 
    * Observe the various items that we can craft.
    * To close the Craft Bench UI, press [`Esc`](/wiki/Controls "Controls").
  * Across from it is the [HUB Terminal](/wiki/HUB_Terminal "HUB Terminal"). Interact [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to use it. 
    * In its UI there is a selection of [Milestones](/wiki/Milestones "Milestones") available to unlock. Select 'Tier 0' then click 'Hub Upgrade 1'. Click 'Select Milestone' to confirm. 
      * _See[Milestones](/wiki/Milestones "Milestones") for a complete list_.
    * It prompts us to input 10 [Iron Rods](/wiki/Iron_Rod "Iron Rod") to complete the milestone. Close the UI [`Esc`](/wiki/Controls "Controls").
    * Milestone requirements are displayed at the top-right of the game screen.
  * Use the Craft Bench and select Iron Rod. Its option is greyed out, and displays 'Can't Afford Recipe'. 
    * Hover over the icon below the 'Cost'. It shows that an Iron Rod requires one [Iron Ingot](/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot") to craft.
  * Craft at least 10 Iron Ingots. Select the recipe, then click [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") and hold the craft button. 
    * Alternatively, hold [`Space`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to craft. You can also press [`⇧ Shift`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")+[`Space`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to make the game hold the craft button for you. It will stay held even if you click to another recipe. Press [`⇧ Shift`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")+[`Space`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") again to toggle this off.
    * Craft all the Iron Ingots we can afford, consuming all the Iron Ore in the [inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory").
  * Divide half of the Iron Ingots to craft [Iron Rods](/wiki/Iron_Rod "Iron Rod") and the other half to craft [Iron Plates](/wiki/Iron_Plate "Iron Plate"). 
    * When done crafting there should be slightly more Iron Rods than Iron Plates.
  * Open the HUB terminal and put 10 Iron Rods into it. 
    * At the top right the 'Relevant Items' are displayed. [`Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")+[](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") to transfer all the required items into it.
    * Alternatively, drag-click or shift-click to transfer the items.
  * Click 'Upgrade HUB'. The HUB Upgrade 1 is now completed.
  * Do not rush for HUB Upgrade 2 yet. Use the remaining resources to begin basic automation. 
    * As a rule of thumb, automation comes before progression.



### HUB Upgrade 2

  * There are six HUB upgrades.
  * A small [Personal Storage Box](/wiki/Personal_Storage_Box "Personal Storage Box") is added beside the HUB terminal. 
    * You can store items in it to free up some [inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") space.
    * New unlocked HUB features are marked with an exclamation ! mark.
  * Open the build menu [`Q`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") and build an Equipment Workshop just outside and near the HUB. 
    * Select 'Production' then click on '[Equipment Workshop](/wiki/Equipment_Workshop "Equipment Workshop")'.
    * New unlocked buildings are highlighted with 'new'. Mouse hover over them to clear the highlight.
  * If the hologram intersects with an existing building, it means it cannot be built there. Observe the red-colored hitbox and move the hologram away from it. 
    * Observe the building cost of the Equipment Workshop. Building materials are consumed from the inventory.
    * If the building materials are insufficient, use the Craft Bench to craft more.
    * You can dismantle a building at any time to get back a full refund.
    * You can also build additional [Craft Benches](/wiki/Craft_Bench "Craft Bench") anywhere.
  * Use the [Equipment Workshop](/wiki/Equipment_Workshop "Equipment Workshop") to craft five [Portable Miners](/wiki/Portable_Miner "Portable Miner"). 
    * [Equipment](/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") can only be crafted at the Equipment Workshop. Most other items can be crafted at the Crafting Bench.
  * Place five Portable Miners on the Iron node: 
    * Go to the Iron nodes and stand at the center of the nearest node.
    * Double-[](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") to equip the Potable Miner in your hand slot. 
      * Notice this will unequip the [Xeno-Zapper](/wiki/Xeno-Zapper "Xeno-Zapper") from your hand slot.
    * Aim at the Resource Node until it displays 'Press E to mine Iron Ore (normal)', then click [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") to place it down.
    * Place the Portable Miners in an arc shape, centered on you. 
      * For safety, remember to re-equip the Xeno-Zapper.


  * [](/wiki/File:Starting_Base.png "The HUB and an Equipment Workshop, built near the Iron patch.")

[The HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB") and an [Equipment Workshop](/wiki/Equipment_Workshop "Equipment Workshop"), built near the Iron patch.

  * [](/wiki/File:Portable_Miners.png "Several Portable Miners placed in an arc on an Iron Node.")

Several [Portable Miners](/wiki/Portable_Miner "Portable Miner") placed in an arc on an Iron Node.



  * After a few seconds, interact [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") with each of them and click 'Grab All' to take out the [Iron Ores](/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore"). 
    * From now on we do not have to manually mine ore from the node.
    * A Portable Miner stops mining after its output slot is filled with a [stack](/wiki/Stack "Stack") of 100 ore.
  * Once you have 100 Iron Ore in your inventory, go back to the HUB.
  * Use the Craft Bench to craft the necessary items required to complete the [Milestone](/wiki/Milestone "Milestone") \- HUB Upgrade 2.



### HUB Upgrade 3

  * The [Smelter](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter") is unlocked. It smelts [Iron Ingots](/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot") automatically. 
    * It needs [Wire](/wiki/Wire "Wire") to be built, in addition to [Iron Rods](/wiki/Iron_Rod "Iron Rod").
  * Scanner: [Copper Ore](/wiki/Copper_Ore "Copper Ore") unlocked. To craft Wires, we need to mine Copper Ore.
  * Use the [Resource Scanner](/wiki/Resource_Scanner "Resource Scanner") (hold [`V`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")), and a scanning wheel appears. Use the mouse to move around the wheel and select 'Copper', then release [`V`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). 
    * A quick tap on the [Resource Scanner](/wiki/Resource_Scanner "Resource Scanner") key re-scans for the previously selected resource type without popping up the scanning wheel.
  * The nearest Copper node is about 200 meters northeast of the base. Bring three [Portable Miners](/wiki/Portable_Miner "Portable Miner"). 
    * Free up at least five [inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") slots by storing some items (leaves, wood, Iron Ore) into the [Personal Storage Box](/wiki/Personal_Storage_Box "Personal Storage Box") beside the [HUB Terminal](/wiki/HUB_Terminal "HUB Terminal").
    * There is a [Spitter](/wiki/Spitter "Spitter") guarding the Copper node; be prepared and exterminate it.
  * Mine out the Copper deposit for a handful of [Copper Ore](/wiki/Copper_Ore "Copper Ore"), then place three Portable Miners on the Copper node.
  * Beside it is a [Limestone](/wiki/Limestone "Limestone") node. Mine out its deposit too. 
    * We do not have to place Portable Miners there as there is another Limestone node just in front of our base.
    * Find the Limestone node due south of our base by visually looking for it and place three Portable Miners there.
  * Behind the HUB is a [Biomass Burner](/wiki/Biomass_Burner "Biomass Burner"). Use [`Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")+[](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") to put all of the [Leaves](/wiki/Leaves "Leaves") in it. 
    * Its UI indicates that it generates 20 MW of [Power](/wiki/Power "Power"). Each pile of leaves lasts for 0.8 seconds at full operation, but none will be consumed yet.
    * It displays 'NO CONNECTION' as we have yet to connect any power consumer [building](/wiki/Building "Building") to it.
  * Build a [Smelter](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter") nearby and connect to the Biomass Burner with a [Power Line](/wiki/Power_Line "Power Line"). 
    * Craft necessary [Wires](/wiki/Wire "Wire"), [Cables](/wiki/Cable "Cable") and [Iron Rods](/wiki/Iron_Rod "Iron Rod") for the building materials.
    * Build only one Smelter. We can build more of them later.
  * Interact [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") with the Smelter, then select 'Iron Ingot'. 
    * If you wish to craft [Copper Ingot](/wiki/Copper_Ingot "Copper Ingot"), you can switch the recipe by clicking at the top left 'Select Recipe', then click 'Copper Ingot' to change it.
    * If a building's recipe is changed, all its contents will be transferred to the [Inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory").
  * Put 100 Iron Ore into the Smelter. Observe its UI: 
    * On the left is the input ingredient and the consumption rate.
    * On the right is the output product and the production rate.
    * Below that is the [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") consumption of this building and how much time is required to perform a crafting cycle (in this case, one Iron Ingot).
  * After 100 Iron Ingots are smelted, the Smelter stops. [`Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")+[](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") to take out all the Iron Ingots. Put in another [stack](/wiki/Stack "Stack") of Iron Ore. 
    * [Iron Ore](/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore") has a stack size of 100. See individual item pages to find out their [stack](/wiki/Stack "Stack") sizes.
  * Interact with the Biomass Burner: 
    * Observe how quickly the Leaves are being consumed. Although it displays '0.8 seconds', each Leaves item lasts for four seconds.
    * This is because all Power Generators, including Biomass Burners, consume [Fuels](/wiki/Fuels "Fuels") proportionally to their Power consumption.
    * Currently only 20% of the [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") is being utilized (4 MW out of 20 MW). Thus its fuel last five times as long (20 / 4 = 500 %).
  * Using the Iron Ingots produced by the Smelter, complete the HUB Upgrade 3. 
    * Using Smelters to craft Ingots is more effective compared to manual crafting as Ingots generally require multiple crafting clicks (3 each).



### HUB Upgrade 4

  * Use the [Limestone](/wiki/Limestone "Limestone") obtained from the Limestone deposit and craft it into [Concrete](/wiki/Concrete "Concrete").
  * The unlocked [Power Pole](/wiki/Power_Pole "Power Pole") enables us to connect more [Smelters](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter") to the [Power Grid](/wiki/Power_Grid "Power Grid"). 
    * As `20 MW / 4 MW = 5`, five Smelters can fully utilize a Biomass Burner.
  * In the build menu, add four Smelters, three Power Poles and seven [Power Lines](/wiki/Power_Line "Power Line") to the [To Do List](/wiki/To_Do_List "To Do List"). 
    * Observe the building material required as displayed in the To Do List window at the right. Craft all necessary material.
    * Go back to the respective [Resource Node](/wiki/Resource_Node "Resource Node") and grab more of the resource from the [Portable Miners](/wiki/Portable_Miner "Portable Miner") if required.
  * Below the screen is the building [Hotbar](/wiki/Hotbar "Hotbar"). You can set up to 10 building hotkeys per hotbar. 
    * The hotkeys are shortcut keys to build without opening the build menu.
    * In the build menu, mouse hover over 'Smelter'.
    * Press [`Keypad 5`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to set its hotkey to 5.
    * You can set it to other numbers as well, but avoid hotkeys one to four as they are reserved for other buildings.
    * You can scroll between 10 different hotbars with [`Alt`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") \+ [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") scroll.
  * Build four additional Smelters, aligned side-by-side with the first: 
    * Press the hotkey [`5`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") for Smelter.
    * Observe the additional control keys as displayed below the screen. 
      * Notice which keys are assigned to 'Building Eyedropper' and 'Snap to Guideline'. The eyedropper enables us to copy a building's hologram.
    * Press and hold the key assigned to 'Snap to Guideline' [`Left Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") and aim the Smelter hologram at the existing Smelter's side surface. 
      * Use this method to build several buildings in line.
      * While snapping, you can use [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") wheel to rotate the hologram.
      * Make sure all five Smelters have their belt output facing the front.
      * [Belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt") input is indicated with orange dots, while the output is indicated with green brackets.
  * Dismantle [`F`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") the existing [Power Line](/wiki/Power_Line "Power Line"). 
    * This is the tricky one. A Power Line may visually sag down, but its hitbox is a straight line.
    * Aim at the Power Line near the [Biomass Burner](/wiki/Biomass_Burner "Biomass Burner") and dismantle it.
  * Build three [Power Poles](/wiki/Power_Poles "Power Poles") and connect them all with Power Lines as shown below: 
    * Make use of the hotkeys and customize them for your convenience.
    * Ensure each Power Pole is connected to at most two buildings, leaving two connector slots for chaining to other Power Poles. 
      * [Power Poles](/wiki/Power_Poles "Power Poles") with more connectors can be unlocked later.
    * If a Power Line is connected incorrectly, you can always dismantle it and try again.
  * Set four Smelters for smelting [Iron Ingots](/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot") and one Smelter for [Copper Ingots](/wiki/Copper_Ingot "Copper Ingot"). 
    * If the [Biomass Burner](/wiki/Biomass_Burner "Biomass Burner") stops, collect more [Leaves](/wiki/Leaves "Leaves") to feed into it (up to 500 at once).
  * Complete HUB Upgrade 4.


  * [](/wiki/File:To-Do_List_Tutorial.png "To add a building to the To Do List, click on the '+' button as shown.")

To add a building to the [To Do List](/wiki/To_Do_List "To Do List"), click on the '+' button as shown.

Aim the hologram at the side surface of the existing [Smelter](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter") and hold the Snap to Guideline key [`Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to snap to it.

  * [](/wiki/File:Starting_Smelters.png "Five Smelters in a line, all connected to power. Observe the each Power Pole is connected to at most two buildings.")

Five Smelters in a line, all connected to [power](/wiki/Power "Power"). Observe the each [Power Pole](/wiki/Power_Pole "Power Pole") is connected to at most two [buildings](/wiki/Building "Building").




### HUB Upgrade 5

  * The [Conveyor Belt](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt "Conveyor Belt") is unlocked, however, it is not needed yet.
  * Continue manually feeding the ores into the Smelters for Ingots.
  * Rush for HUB Upgrade 5. 
    * Additional [Limestone](/wiki/Limestone "Limestone") can be obtained from the Limestone node in front of the HUB; remember to place [Portable Miners](/wiki/Portable_Miner "Portable Miner") on it.



### HUB Upgrade 6

  * The second [Biomass Burner](/wiki/Biomass_Burner "Biomass Burner") is added to [The HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB"). Connect it to the [Power Grid](/wiki/Power_Grid "Power Grid"). 
    * Build a [Power Line](/wiki/Power_Line "Power Line") between it and the nearest [Power Pole](/wiki/Power_Pole "Power Pole"). Observe its [Indicator Light](/wiki/Indicator_Light "Indicator Light") is showing Red.
    * _Further reading:[Indicator Light](/wiki/Indicator_Light "Indicator Light")_
    * Feed it with Leaves. Its indicator color turns green, meaning that it is running without any problems.
  * We will build five [Constructors](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor") in front of the Smelters, and connect them one-to-one. This acts as a temporary production area. 
    * Add five [Constructors](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor") to the [To Do List](/wiki/To_Do_List "To Do List").
    * Estimate how many Power Poles are needed for the Constructors; we need a Power Pole for every two [buildings](/wiki/Building "Building").
    * `Ceiling (5/2) = 3`. We need three Power Poles. Add them to the To Do List.
    * Add another 10 [Cables](/wiki/Cable "Cable").
    * Add 50 [Conveyor Belts](/wiki/Conveyor_Belts "Conveyor Belts"). A unit of Conveyor Belt is two meters long.
  * Constructors require [Reinforced Iron Plates](/wiki/Reinforced_Iron_Plate "Reinforced Iron Plate") (a.k.a. RIP) which is quite complex to hand-craft at the moment. Thus we add their ingredients to the To Do List as well: 
    * Open Codex [`X`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), the in-game simplified encyclopedia.
    * Click Recipe -> Parts -> Reinforced Iron Plate, and it displays `6 [](/wiki/Iron_Plate "Iron Plate") [Iron Plate](/wiki/Iron_Plate "Iron Plate") + 12 [](/wiki/Screw "Screw") [Screw](/wiki/Screw "Screw") = 1 [](/wiki/Reinforced_Iron_Plate "Reinforced Iron Plate") [Reinforced Iron Plate](/wiki/Reinforced_Iron_Plate "Reinforced Iron Plate")`
    * Hover with the mouse its recipe, then click 'Add to To Do List' until 10 [RIP](/wiki/RIP "RIP") are added to the list. Hold down [`⇧ Shift`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to add 10 at once, or edit the number in the text box and press [`↵ Enter`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). 
      * The ingredients (60 Iron Plates and 120 Screws) are automatically added to the list.
    * You can mouse-scroll the To Do List to see the additional rows of items hidden below.
  * Alternatively, an item's recipe can be viewed by using a [Craft Bench](/wiki/Craft_Bench "Craft Bench"). 
    * [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right") on the item's name to add it to the To Do List.


  * [](/wiki/File:Codex_and_To-Do_List.png "The Codex Window X. Mouse hover the RIP recipe and add 10 RIP to the To Do List.")

  * Manually craft all the material required to fulfill the To Do List. 
    * It might seem like a lot of work compared to manual crafting all the way to HUB Upgrade 6, but this is an investment that will benefit in the long run.
  * Set a hotkey for [Constructor](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor") and make use of it.
  * Stand in front of the middle Smelter, hold the 'Snap to Guideline' key [`Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") and aim at the ground some distance away.
  * Build two [Constructors](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor") each to the left and the right of the middle Constructor, using the snap key.
  * Connect each Constructor with a [Smelter](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter") using [Conveyor Belts](/wiki/Conveyor_Belts "Conveyor Belts"). If a [Power Pole](/wiki/Power_Pole "Power Pole") is in the way, dismantle the Power Pole. 
    * If the belt is too long, additional [Iron Plates](/wiki/Iron_Plate "Iron Plate") will be required.
    * If you cannot connect the belts between them, check if the building belt input and output are rotated correctly.
  * Connect all [buildings](/wiki/Building "Building") with Power Poles and Power Lines.
  * Set the Constructor in front of the [Copper Ingot](/wiki/Copper_Ingot "Copper Ingot") Smelter to '[Wire](/wiki/Wire "Wire")', the next for '[Iron Rod](/wiki/Iron_Rod "Iron Rod")', and the remaining three for '[Iron Plate](/wiki/Iron_Plate "Iron Plate")'. 
    * Feed the Copper and Iron ores into the Smelter and observe the finished products to be produced in the Constructor.
  * Lots of [leaves](/wiki/Leaves "Leaves") will be required to keep the [Biomass Burners](/wiki/Biomass_Burner "Biomass Burner") running. 
    * When gathering the leaves you may run into more hostile creatures.
  * Our first bootstrap factory is completed, however, this setup is only temporary.
  * Open the build menu, then click 'Clear List' on the right side to remove any leftovers in the To Do List.
  * Complete HUB Upgrade 6.



## Tier 1 and Tier 2

  * Immediately remove all the [leaves](/wiki/Leaves "Leaves") from the [Biomass Burners](/wiki/Biomass_Burner "Biomass Burner"). 
    * Craft them into [Biomass](/wiki/Biomass "Biomass"), then insert the Biomass into the Biomass Burners. They burn much longer as they contain much higher fuel value.
    * Interact [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") with any of the [Power Poles](/wiki/Power_Poles "Power Poles") or [Biomass Burners](/wiki/Biomass_Burner "Biomass Burner") and pull down the lever at the left to reset the [power trip](/wiki/Power_trip "Power trip").
    * If the [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") trips again, make sure there are a sufficient number of power generators and each generator has [fuel](/wiki/Fuels "Fuels") in it.
  * Observe new buildings unlocked: 
    * [Biomass Burner](/wiki/Biomass_Burner "Biomass Burner") \- We will build 12 of them, in addition to the two mini burners attached to [The HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB").
    * [Space Elevator](/wiki/Space_Elevator "Space Elevator") \- Used to unlock [Tier 3](/wiki/Tier_3 "Tier 3") Milestones and above, the most important being Tier 3 - Coal Power.
  * Our next long-term target is to set up proper Coal power which will relieve us from the Biomass power generation.



### Speedrunning

  * _This section is only for the players performing speedrunning up to 2nd[Space Elevator](/wiki/Space_Elevator "Space Elevator") delivery._ **Skip this section if you are playing for the first time.**
  * This section is to be read in conjunction with the previous section: #Loot for thought.
  * Start at [Rocky Desert](/wiki/Rocky_Desert "Rocky Desert"), immediately head for the Iron node at the West (below the rocky shade), and rush for HUB Upgrade 1, while avoiding [Flying Crabs](/wiki/Flying_Crab "Flying Crab") at all. 
    * This will expands the [inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") size from 16 to 19, which is important for [Crash Site](/wiki/Crash_Site "Crash Site") looting.
    * Don't forget to dismantle [The HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB") to get back the [HUB Parts](/wiki/HUB_Parts "HUB Parts"), as our actual starting location will be at the six pure Iron nodes in the [Northern Forest](/wiki/Northern_Forest "Northern Forest").
  * Visit the [Lizard Doggo](/wiki/Lizard_Doggo "Lizard Doggo") [cave](/wiki/Cave "Cave") below the [Dangle Spires](/wiki/Dangle_Spires "Dangle Spires") and loot the items on the ground.
  * Visit the Crash Sites at Rocky Desert and Lake Forest as well, as we move towards the actual starting location. 
    * Avoid looting [biomass](/wiki/Biomass "Biomass") during this stage, as they take away inventory slot and biomass is abundant in the Northern Forest.
  * Make sure not to miss out on any Crash Site containing [RIPs](/wiki/RIP "RIP") and [Modular Frames](/wiki/Modular_Frame "Modular Frame").
  * Automate the production of [RIP](/wiki/RIP "RIP") and [Rotor](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor") ASAP, 20 / min each is recommended. To do so you will need [Conveyor Belt Mk.2](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt_Mk.2 "Conveyor Belt Mk.2") to fully utilize a pure miner.
  * Skip Coal Power as they take away a large chunk of [RIP](/wiki/RIP "RIP") and [Rotor](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor"), which should be dedicated to [Smart Platings](/wiki/Smart_Plating "Smart Plating") instead.
  * You will need a lot of [Assemblers](/wiki/Assembler "Assembler") crafting Smart Platings, but don't forget [Versatile Framework](/wiki/Versatile_Framework "Versatile Framework") and [Automated Wiring](/wiki/Automated_Wiring "Automated Wiring").
  * By [sinking](/wiki/Sink "Sink") the loots of various Crash Sites you should be able to convert them into at least 35 [coupons](/wiki/Coupon "Coupon"), sufficient for skipping the Steel chain completely. 
    * Two Coupons for 200 [Steel Pipes](/wiki/Steel_Pipe "Steel Pipe") for unlocking Advanced Steel Production.
    * Three Coupons for 100 [Stators](/wiki/Stator "Stator").
    * 30 Coupons for 3000 [Steel Beams](/wiki/Steel_Beam "Steel Beam").
  * Automate the production of [Solid Biofuel](/wiki/Solid_Biofuel "Solid Biofuel") as you will solely rely on [Biomass Burners](/wiki/Biomass_Burner "Biomass Burner"), and you will need to build a lot of them.
  * It is highly possible that the 2nd delivery can be completed in under four hours, as the writer of this page managed to perform it at 3h5min. [2]
    * Practice makes perfect. Have fun!



### Logistics

  * Craft 100 [Concrete](/wiki/Concrete "Concrete") at the [Craft Bench](/wiki/Craft_Bench "Craft Bench").
  * Grab the produced items (Iron Rod, Iron Plate, Wire) from the bootstrap factory and complete [Tier 1](/wiki/Tier_1 "Tier 1") \- Logistics.



### Obstacle Clearing

  * We will now set up an improved starter factory.
  * Remove the [Portable Miners](/wiki/Portable_Miner "Portable Miner") on the Iron Node and put the ore into the [Smelters](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter"). 
    * Add one [Miner Mk.1](/wiki/Miner_Mk.1 "Miner Mk.1"), two [Splitters](/wiki/Splitter "Splitter"), two [Smelters](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter"), four [Constructors](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor") and three [Storage Containers](/wiki/Storage_Container "Storage Container") to the [To Do List](/wiki/To_Do_List "To Do List").
    * Estimate the amount of [Power Poles](/wiki/Power_Poles "Power Poles"), [Power Lines](/wiki/Power_Line "Power Line"), and [Conveyor Belts](/wiki/Conveyor_Belts "Conveyor Belts") required to connect the buildings.
  * Build a Miner Mk.1 at the right-most Iron node which is nearest to [the HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB"). 
    * On the compass it is the easternmost Iron node.
    * Rotate [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") the Miner hologram to face the open area to the South then build it. 
      * A building hologram aimed at non-foundation can be rotated by 10-degree intervals.
  * Build two Smelters in front of it with one of the Smelters aligned [`Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") with the Miner. Set both to smelt '[Iron Ingot](/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot")'. 
    * Connect the aligned Smelter and the Miner with a [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt").
  * Aim a [Splitter](/wiki/Splitter "Splitter") at the middle of the belt and build it. 
    * Connect a side output of the Splitter to the second Smelter.
    * The other output of the Splitter will not be used. Leave it unconnected.
    * These are the basics of splitting a belt. _Further reading:[Splitter](/wiki/Splitter "Splitter")_
  * Observe [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") the UIs for the Miner and a Smelter. 
    * A Miner Mk.1 produces 60 [Iron Ore](/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore") per minute. _Continue reading:[Miner Mk.1](/wiki/Miner_Mk.1 "Miner Mk.1")_
    * A Smelter requires 30 Iron Ore per minute. _Continue reading:[Smelter](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter")_
    * As `60 / 30 = 2`, a Miner Mk.1's output is sufficient for two Smelters.
    * In some cases you may get decimals. In that case, always round up (ceiling).
  * Build the [Constructors](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor") as shown below. Connect them with [belts](/wiki/Belt "Belt") and [power](/wiki/Power "Power"). Set their recipes as shown in the schematic. 
    * _For more complex production lines, use[Online tools](/wiki/Online_tools "Online tools") to assist you_.
  * Troubleshooting: 
    * Cannot connect [belts](/wiki/Belt "Belt") to [buildings](/wiki/Building "Building") \- Make sure the building is aligned and rotated properly. Buildings and belts have orange arrows for input and green arrows for output in their holograms.
    * Encroaching other's clearance - Move the buildings around and ensure there is sufficient space in-between. Take note of the hitbox highlighted in red when the encroachment warning appears.
  * Estimate the power usage and expand the [power](/wiki/Power "Power") infrastructure accordingly: 
    * Build an additional four [Biomass Burners](/wiki/Biomass_Burner "Biomass Burner") near the initial two Biomass Burners.
    * Link them all to the same [Power Grid](/wiki/Power_Grid "Power Grid") for easy management.
    * Have a [Storage Container](/wiki/Storage_Container "Storage Container") nearby for storing all the [Leaves](/wiki/Leaves "Leaves"), [Woods](/wiki/Wood "Wood") and [Biomass](/wiki/Biomass "Biomass") for easier refill.
    * Optional: build a Constructor for converting Leaves to Biomass with a Container on each end.
  * Once the Iron Rods, Iron Plates, and Screws Storage Containers start to fill up, dismantle the old bootstrap factory and replace it with eight additional Biomass Burners. 
    * The [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") capacity should now be increased to 400 MW. `2 * 20 + (12 * 30) = 400`.
    * Holding down [`Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") while dismantling enables mass-dismantle, up to 50 buildings at once.
    * Items will be transferred to a [Crate](/wiki/Crate "Crate") if there are insufficient empty slots in the pioneer's [inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") during dismantle.

  * Make a similar setup, tapped from the center Iron node. This doubles the production rate of Iron Plates, Iron Rods, and Screws. 
    * 'Tapping a node' means building a [Miner](/wiki/Miner "Miner") on top of a node and mining its resources.
  * At the Copper node, build the following: 
    * A Miner, two Smelters for Copper Ingots, four Constructors for [Wire](/wiki/Wire "Wire"), and one Constructor for [Cable](/wiki/Cable "Cable"), using the output of two of the Wire Constructors.
    * A [Merger](/wiki/Merger "Merger") is used to merge multiple belts into a single belt. Use it to merge two Wire belts to feed into the Cable Constructor.

  * Use both of the [Limestone](/wiki/Limestone "Limestone") nodes nearby to produce [Concrete](/wiki/Concrete "Concrete").
  * Manually calculate how many Contructors are needed for each node. 
    * Open up the search function [`N`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") and type the following: `60 / 45`, and observe the result ` = 1.333`.
    * Take note that the max item flow rate is limited by the belt speed, measured in items/min. The speed of a belt can be viewed in the build menu.
    * We will need lots of [Concrete](/wiki/Concrete "Concrete") to make [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations"), so start piling them up for [Tier 3](/wiki/Tier_3 "Tier 3").
  * The [power grid](/wiki/Power_grid "Power grid") might trip during this process. To avoid this, refuel the Biomass Burners regularly.

### Part Assembly

  * Craft a [Chainsaw](/wiki/Chainsaw "Chainsaw") in the [Equipment Workshop](/wiki/Equipment_Workshop "Equipment Workshop") then equip it. 
    * At the bottom left, a warning displays that [Solid Biofuel](/wiki/Solid_Biofuel "Solid Biofuel") is missing from the [inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory").
    * A Chainsaw requires [Solid Biofuel](/wiki/Solid_Biofuel "Solid Biofuel") to operate. Craft some Solid Biofuel at the [Craft Bench](/wiki/Craft_Bench "Craft Bench").
  * Saw down all the trees nearby and craft them into Solid Biofuel; automate this process with [Constructors](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor"). Manual crafting can take a longer time.
  * Avoid cutting the [Nut](/wiki/Nut "Nut") tree and [Berry](/wiki/Berry "Berry") flower, as their fruits regrow every three days (150 minutes in real-time). 
    * Set up two individual lines: Storage Container (Leaves) - Constructor (Leaves -> Biomass) - Constructor (Biomass -> Solid Biofuel) - Storage Container. The other using Biomass - Wood.

### Base Building

  * Use the third Iron node to set up the production for [RIP](/wiki/RIP "RIP") and [Rotor](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor"): 
    * For the Rotor setup, additional Iron nodes are needed. Use the [Resource Scanner](/wiki/Resource_Scanner "Resource Scanner") to find more Iron nodes.
  * There are four Iron nodes located 500 meters west of the base. Find them and use [belts](/wiki/Belt "Belt") to bring the [Iron Ore](/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore") back.


  * [](/wiki/File:Reinforced_Iron_Plate_and_Rotor_production.png "An early setup of RIP and Rotor using 1.25 Iron nodes.")

  * Build another copy of the above [RIP](/wiki/RIP "RIP") and [Rotor](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor") setup using the remaining available Iron nodes. 
    * Combine them with an [Assembler](/wiki/Assembler "Assembler") to produce [Smart Plating](/wiki/Smart_Plating "Smart Plating").
  * Make a production line for [Copper Sheet](/wiki/Copper_Sheet "Copper Sheet"). They will be used in Coal Power later on. 
    * Add a [Miner Mk.1](/wiki/Miner_Mk.1 "Miner Mk.1") to the [To Do List](/wiki/To_Do_List "To Do List") and prepare plenty of [Iron Plates](/wiki/Iron_Plate "Iron Plate") in the [inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory").
    * Go West until you see a river. Follow the river downstream to the far West.
    * Construct [Power Lines](/wiki/Power_Line "Power Line") as you move on.
  * There are plenty of Copper nodes by the sea; use one of them for Copper Sheet production. 
    * Either build locally (close to the node) or centralize the production (bring the ore back to the base). Either way, the Storage Container for storing the Copper Sheets should be built near the base.
  * As a rule of thumb, whenever a new recipe is unlocked, try to automate its production ASAP. Keep manual crafting at a minimum.
  * Complete [Tier 1](/wiki/Tier_1 "Tier 1") \- Base Building to unlock [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations").



### Field Research

  * Starting from [Tier 1](/wiki/Tier_1 "Tier 1"), there is a cooldown after completing each milestone. Its timer is displayed at the top right.
  * While waiting for the cool down, we are going to collect a [Power Slug](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug") southwest of [the HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB"). Save the game. 
    * Move South towards the river and find the Power Slug. It is located on a small island in the river.
    * Find the football-shaped stone and collect the [Green Power Slug](/wiki/Green_Power_Slug "Green Power Slug") from the crack. Quickly pick it up before the [Spore Flower](/wiki/Spore_Flower "Spore Flower") starts to release [Poison Gas](/wiki/Poison_Gas "Poison Gas").
    * Store the Power Slug in the HUB's [Personal Storage Box](/wiki/Personal_Storage_Box "Personal Storage Box").
  * Complete [Tier 1](/wiki/Tier_1 "Tier 1") \- Field Research.



### Logistics Mk.2

  * Build the [MAM](/wiki/MAM "MAM") somewhere near [the HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB").
  * [Research](/wiki/Research "Research") all the options currently available. _Read more:[MAM](/wiki/MAM "MAM")_
    * Start with the 3-second researches, then progress to the longer researches.
    * Prioritize unlocking [Overclocking](/wiki/Overclock "Overclock"), Slug Scanning, and Nuts Scanning.
  * A second-hand slot can be unlocked. Drag and drop the [Nuts](/wiki/Nut "Nut") to the 2nd hand slot to equip them. 
    * Use [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") scroll to cycle between hand items. This allows easier healing during combat.
  * Craft an [Object Scanner](/wiki/Object_Scanner "Object Scanner") in the [Equipment Workshop](/wiki/Equipment_Workshop "Equipment Workshop") and equip it. 
    * Right-click until it displays '[Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug")' on its UI, or by looking at the bottom left.
  * Find at least one more Power Slug using the Object Scanner, then craft them all into [Power Shards](/wiki/Power_Shard "Power Shard") at a [Craft Bench](/wiki/Craft_Bench "Craft Bench").
  * Review our [Concrete](/wiki/Concrete "Concrete") setup at the [Limestone](/wiki/Limestone "Limestone") node: 
    * You are probably using a one [Miner](/wiki/Miner "Miner") \- two [Constructor](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor") \- one [Storage Container](/wiki/Storage_Container "Storage Container") setup.
    * If not, go back and read Obstacle Clearing.
  * To match the consumption of Limestone in the Constructors with the production of Limestone in the Miner, there are a few approaches: 
    * [Underclock](/wiki/Underclock "Underclock") the higher (60 Limestone Production, 60 Limestone Consumption) by setting both Constructors to 67%.
    * [Overclock](/wiki/Overclock "Overclock") the miner (90 Limestone Production, 90 Limestone Consumption). Insert a [Power Shard](/wiki/Power_Shard "Power Shard") into the [Miner Mk.1](/wiki/Miner_Mk.1 "Miner Mk.1") then overclock it to 150%. Check that the production ratio matches. 
      * As the belt speed is currently limited to 60 items/min, avoid overclocking now.
    * Where there are decimals, always round up the number instead of rounding it down. For example, `66.6% -> 67%`.
    * Overclocking a building will increase its power consumption, and vice versa.
    * Check the [Rotor](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor") and [Reinforced Iron Plate](/wiki/Reinforced_Iron_Plate "Reinforced Iron Plate") [Assemblers](/wiki/Assembler "Assembler") and underclock them accordingly.
    * _Further reading:[Clock Speed](/wiki/Clock_Speed "Clock Speed")_

  * Complete [Tier 2](/wiki/Tier_2 "Tier 2") \- Logistics Mk.2.



### Project Assembly - Platform

  * Find a large open space and build the [Space Elevator](/wiki/Space_Elevator "Space Elevator"), if you have not yet built it. 
    * Building sizes can be viewed on their individual wiki pages. For example, look at the infobox of [Space Elevator](/wiki/Space_Elevator "Space Elevator") and observe its Length, Width, and Height in meters.
    * A [foundation](/wiki/Foundation "Foundation") is eight meters long x eight meters wide.
  * As the Space Elevator is not frequently used, we can build it some distance away.
  * The first space delivery requires 50 [Smart Platings](/wiki/Smart_Plating "Smart Plating"). 
    * Increase the production of Smart Plating to reduce the waiting time, either by overclocking or building more machines.
    * Either deliver the material manually (by interacting) or use a [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt") connection.
  * Once the requirements are met, pull down the lever (Load -> Seal -> Send) and send the package. Observe the Space Elevator's delivery animation.
  * It is not compulsory to complete all Tier 1 and Tier 2 milestones before unlocking Tier 3. For now, we will skip the Jump Pads and Resource Sink Bonus Program for later.



## Tier 3 and Tier 4

### Coal Power

  * Dismantle the [Assemblers](/wiki/Assembler "Assembler") producing [Smart Platings](/wiki/Smart_Plating "Smart Plating"). We will not need them for a while. 
    * Connect the 2nd set of [RIP](/wiki/RIP "RIP") and [Rotor](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor") outputs to [Storage Containers](/wiki/Storage_Container "Storage Container") to buffer their products.
  * Complete [Tier 3](/wiki/Tier_3 "Tier 3") \- Coal Power. 
    * We need many RIP and Rotors to complete this milestone. Luckily, we have automated their production to have the material ready to go.



### Setting up the Coal power

  * We are ready to set up a fully-automated power production with [Coal Generators](/wiki/Coal_Generator "Coal Generator"). 
    * Once it is set up, we can get rid of all the [Biomass Burners](/wiki/Biomass_Burner "Biomass Burner"). Say goodbye to tree-cutting!
  * Scan [`V`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") for [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal"). It is located at some distance East of the base.
  * Add eight [Coal Generators](/wiki/Coal_Generator "Coal Generator"), three [Water Extractors](/wiki/Water_Extractor "Water Extractor") and two [Miner Mk.1](/wiki/Miner_Mk.1 "Miner Mk.1") to the [To Do List](/wiki/To_Do_List "To Do List"). 
    * In addition, prepare plenty of [Concrete](/wiki/Concrete "Concrete"), [Cables](/wiki/Cable "Cable") and [Copper Sheets](/wiki/Copper_Sheet "Copper Sheet").
  * Save the game.
  * Move towards the [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal") patch. Keep left to avoid the [Poison Gas](/wiki/Poison_Gas "Poison Gas"). You will come across a [Crash Site](/wiki/Crash_Site "Crash Site"). 
    * Loot the items laying around.
    * Use nine [Modular Frames](/wiki/Modular_Frame "Modular Frame"), which you just looted, to unlock the crashed [FICSIT Freighter](/wiki/FICSIT_Freighter "FICSIT Freighter") and retrieve the [Hard Drive](/wiki/Hard_Drive "Hard Drive").
    * Build a [MAM](/wiki/MAM "MAM") there and research the Hard Drive. _Further reading:[Hard Drive](/wiki/Hard_Drive "Hard Drive")_
    * You don't have to wait for the [research](/wiki/Research "Research") to complete, we will look into it later. Dismantle the MAM and proceed to the Coal patch.
  * There are plenty of Coal nodes there. Tap the two nearest to the river delta. 
    * There is an [Alpha Hog](/wiki/Alpha_Hog "Alpha Hog") guarding the island in the middle of the river, approach with care, and kill it.
  * Across the delta, use [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations") to build a 12 x 4 platform, near sea level. 
    * 'Foundation' refers to the individual tiles that you can build. 'Platform' refers to a group of foundations on where you or the factory resides.
    * Ensure the long side is fully in contact with deep water.
    * Build a pier-like structure to link the platform to the land.
    * Whether to use Foundation 8m x 4m, 8m x 2m, or 8m x 1m is up to your preference.
  * Build eight [Coal Generators](/wiki/Coal_Generator "Coal Generator") in a row. Connect them in [Manifold](/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") style, four in each group. 
    * Build [Splitters](/wiki/Splitter "Splitter") before connecting them with [belts](/wiki/Belt "Belt"). Align the Splitters in the same direction with the input side from the [Miner](/wiki/Miner "Miner").
  * The first four generators receive Coal from the first [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt"); the remaining take from the second belt.
  * Build [Stackable Conveyor Pole](/wiki/Stackable_Conveyor_Pole "Stackable Conveyor Pole") near the 1st and 4th Splitter. 
    * [Stackable Conveyor Pole](/wiki/Stackable_Conveyor_Pole "Stackable Conveyor Pole") is unlocked at [Tier 2](/wiki/Tier_2 "Tier 2") \- Logistics Mk.2.
  * Build the 2nd belt above the 1st belt, snapping on the Stackable Conveyor Pole, as shown below.


  * [](/wiki/File:Coal_nodes.png "Coal nodes nearby the water body are useful for setting up the Coal Power.")

[Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal") nodes nearby the water body are useful for setting up the [Coal Power](/wiki/Tier_3 "Tier 3").

Use [Stackable Conveyor Pole](/wiki/Stackable_Conveyor_Pole "Stackable Conveyor Pole") to elevate a belt so they can stack on top of each other.



  * Build a [Pipeline Junction Cross](/wiki/Pipeline_Junction_Cross "Pipeline Junction Cross") in front of each Coal Generator's pipe connector; avoid colliding with belts and splitters. 
    * Let's label these Junctions one to 8.
  * Build additional Pipeline Junctions in between junction two and three, four and five, six and seven. Let's name them A, B, and C.
  * Connect all the Junctions and Coal Generator pipe inlets with [Pipelines](/wiki/Pipelines "Pipelines").
  * Extend the [ladder](/wiki/Ladder "Ladder") or [Stackable Conveyor Pole](/wiki/Stackable_Conveyor_Pole "Stackable Conveyor Pole") near the 4th Splitter as shown, up to 15 segments high (30 meters), then climb up and look towards the [water](/wiki/Water "Water"). 
    * It is much easier to build [Water Extractors](/wiki/Water_Extractor "Water Extractor") while standing at a higher elevation, as the hologram is centered at the underwater point aimed at by the cursor.
  * In front of each Pipeline Junction A to C, carefully place a [Water Extractor](/wiki/Water_Extractor "Water Extractor") with its pipe outlet facing the Junction. 
    * Water Extractors cannot be snapped to guidelines, so we have to manually adjust their placement.
    * When building Water Extractors side by side, look carefully at the bottom far corner of the encroachment box. Build them as close as possible, but not encroaching on each other.
  * Connect Water Extractors to the pipe network. 
    * If you have trouble connecting [Pipelines](/wiki/Pipelines "Pipelines"), or if they are curved in weird shapes, try to toggle the build mode [`R`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") when building them.
  * Dismantle the tall ladder, except the bottom-most segment.
  * Connect the [belts](/wiki/Belt "Belt") between the [manifold](/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") input and the Coal [Miners](/wiki/Miner "Miner").
  * Connect the [Power Lines](/wiki/Power_Line "Power Line") between Coal Generators, Water Extractors, and Miners, but don't connect them to the main [Power Grid](/wiki/Power_Grid "Power Grid") (at the base) yet.
  * Prime the system with three [Biomass Burners](/wiki/Biomass_Burner "Biomass Burner"): 
    * Manually mine 100 Coal and fuel any Coal Generator we have built.
    * Temporarily build three Biomass Burners somewhere nearby, connect them to the Coal Power, then fuel them with some [leaves](/wiki/Leaves "Leaves") nearby.
    * Once the system is up and running, dismantle the Biomass Burners.
  * Check the system by interacting with a Power Pole; it should display a [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") capacity of `8 * 75 MW = 600 MW`. If not, look at the Coal Generators' / Water Extractors' [Indicator Lights](/wiki/Indicator_Light "Indicator Light") and check which building is not running. 
    * A Red indicator means the building is not working properly. Check the belt, power, and pipe connections.
  * Connect the Power Line from the Coal Power back to the base.
  * As the path back to the base is mostly blocked by cliffs, we need to find a way to climb it up. 
    * We can build ladders with the [Stackable Conveyor Pole](/wiki/Stackable_Conveyor_Pole "Stackable Conveyor Pole").
    * We can build a Conveyor Pole at the low ground, a [splitter](/wiki/Splitter "Splitter") at the edge of the cliff at high ground, then connect them with a belt. Walk on the belt to climb up. 
      * If the Splitter is in your way, remove it before climbing up.
      * If the belt has the same direction as your travel direction, walking on it will give a speed boost.
      * If the belt is against your travel direction, it can slow you down. Walk on the belt's edge (the railing part) to avoid being pushed back.
    * Alternatively, you can walk around the cliff; this may take a longer time to travel across.

  * Once you have returned to the base, dismantle all the [Biomass Burners](/wiki/Biomass_Burner "Biomass Burner") there. 
    * The two mini burners at the HUB cannot be removed. Just leave them unfueled.
  * Congratulations! From now on we are no longer required to cut down trees or bushes to fuel the Biomass Burners again. The Coal Power (600MW) should last for a while.
  * Our next long-term target is to unlock Tier 5 and Tier 6. We will proceed to build Steel Production for that. 
    * Further reading: #Coal Power 2



### Blade Runners

  * Check the [MAM](/wiki/MAM "MAM"). The research of [Hard Drive](/wiki/Hard_Drive "Hard Drive") should be completed by now, prompting you to pick one [Alternate Recipe](/wiki/Alternate_Recipe "Alternate Recipe") among 3. 
    * _Read[here](/wiki/Hard_Drive#Alternate_recipe_analysis "Hard Drive") for more info._
  * We will now get a pair of [Blade Runners](/wiki/Blade_Runners "Blade Runners") for improved movement speed and jump.
  * From [the HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB"), look South and find the small cliff as shown below. 
    * Get there and kill the [Flying Crabs](/wiki/Flying_Crab "Flying Crab") in your way.
    * Use the [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt") trick to climb up the cliff as mentioned before. You can use [Ramps](/wiki/Ramps "Ramps") too.
  * Mine 210 [Caterium Ore](/wiki/Caterium_Ore "Caterium Ore") manually or with a [Portable Miner](/wiki/Portable_Miner "Portable Miner").
  * Remove the Portable Miner, then build a [Miner](/wiki/Miner "Miner") there. 
    * Use a belt to bring the Caterium Ore down the cliff and connect it to a [Smelter](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter"), then a [Constructor](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor"), followed by a [Storage Container](/wiki/Storage_Container "Storage Container").
    * If 'too steep' warning is displayed, use [Conveyor Lift](/wiki/Conveyor_Lift "Conveyor Lift") to transport items vertically.
  * Connect the [Power Lines](/wiki/Power_Line "Power Line").
  * Look at the [Caterium Research](/wiki/Caterium_Research "Caterium Research") in the [MAM](/wiki/MAM "MAM"). Unlock Caterium, [Caterium Ingot](/wiki/Caterium_Ingot "Caterium Ingot") and [Quickwire](/wiki/Quickwire "Quickwire"). 
    * You may need to craft some of the items manually.
    * You can pick up the items on a [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt") with [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls").
  * Once the recipes for [Caterium Ingot](/wiki/Caterium_Ingot "Caterium Ingot") and [Quickwire](/wiki/Quickwire "Quickwire") are unlocked, set the Smelter and Constructor that you just built to automate them. 
    * 'Automate' refers to automated production, mostly using machines.
  * Now you have a steady production of Quickwire; continue researching down the [Caterium Research](/wiki/Caterium_Research "Caterium Research") tree until you unlock the [Blade Runners](/wiki/Blade_Runners "Blade Runners").

  * Craft a pair of [Blade Runners](/wiki/Blade_Runners "Blade Runners") and equip it. Enjoy the faster movement speed and improved jump height.
  * Unlock [Power Pole Mk.2](/wiki/Power_Pole_Mk.2 "Power Pole Mk.2") as it has 7 connectors instead of 4. 
    * Reserving two for chaining Power Poles, this leaves us five power connections available for buildings.
    * Set its hotkey as one to replace the Power Pole hotkey.
    * Power Poles and Conveyor Belts can be upgraded in-place, similar to Miners. Aim the hologram of the Mk.2 pole at the Mk.1 pole to upgrade it.
  * Revisit the North-West area with four pure Iron nodes. Tap all of them if you haven't done so.
  * We have seven Iron nodes now. After subtracting the 4.5 belts we have been utilizing for the automation of RIP and Rotor, there are still 2.5 belts of Iron Ores left.
  * Set up the [Modular Frame](/wiki/Modular_Frame "Modular Frame") production as shown. 
    * it is advised to use your own creativity or refer to [online calculators](/wiki/Tools "Tools") to plan the layout.
    * Check through the buildings in the chain and [underclock](/wiki/Underclock "Underclock") where necessary.

    * _Further Reading:[Xeno-Basher](/wiki/Xeno-Basher "Xeno-Basher")_



### Map

  * Complete all the possible researches in the [MAM](/wiki/MAM "MAM") with material available, especially those that increase [inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") size.
  * Bring plenty of [Beryl Nuts](/wiki/Beryl_Nut "Beryl Nut"), you will need them for [healing](/wiki/Health "Health") later on, as well as several Portable Miners.
  * _Read[Stinger](/wiki/Stinger "Stinger") to learn how to kill them._
  * Go to where you have set up the Coal Power. From the [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal") nodes and look West, find the [cave](/wiki/Cave "Cave") entrance covered with vines as shown below.


  * [](/wiki/File:Northwest_cave_entrance.png "From the Coal nodes by the delta, look West and find the entrance to the cave.")

From the [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal") nodes by the delta, look West and find the entrance to the [cave](/wiki/Cave "Cave").



  * Open the flashlight [`B`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") then enter the cave.
  * There are some reddish mushrooms on the cave floor, called [Mycelia](/wiki/Mycelia "Mycelia"). Use a [Chainsaw](/wiki/Chainsaw "Chainsaw") to cut them down for [Mycelia Research](/wiki/Mycelia_Research "Mycelia Research"). 
    * While cutting, some stones will also be removed, transferring [Limestones](/wiki/Limestone "Limestone") into the [inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory"). Drag the Limestones to the trash slot to delete them, this will free up inventory space.
  * There are [](/wiki/Stinger "Stinger") [Stinger](/wiki/Stinger "Stinger")s guarding the cavern. If you move in too fast you will aggro all of them at once. Move forward slowly, aggro one at a time to kill them one-by-one.
  * After the cavern is a fork. The smaller cave on the right leads underwater which contains a [Yellow Power Slug](/wiki/Green_Power_Slug "Green Power Slug").
  * Go to the left to advance.
  * There are several [Large Stingers](/wiki/Large_Stinger "Large Stinger") guarding the [Quartz](/wiki/Quartz "Quartz") node. Kill them. 
    * Place seven [Portable Miners](/wiki/Portable_Miner "Portable Miner") on the Quartz node and mine 700 [Raw Quartz](/wiki/Raw_Quartz "Raw Quartz").
  * A fog might start to appear in the meantime, reducing visibility. 
    * It is advised to wait until the fog dissipates.
  * There are several [Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug") on the ceiling of the cave. It is advised to collect them after unlocking the [Jetpack](/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack") at [Tier 6](/wiki/Tier_6 "Tier 6"). 
    * Alternatively, build [ladders](/wiki/Ladder "Ladder") to reach them.
  * Continue moving West until you see the 2nd Quartz node. Place a [Miner](/wiki/Miner "Miner") down and connect it with a Power Line. 
    * Do not connect the belt yet; we will return here later after the [Conveyor Belt Mk.3](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt_Mk.3 "Conveyor Belt Mk.3") is unlocked.
  * Return to the first Quartz node and pick up all the Portable Miners. Keep the [Raw Quartz](/wiki/Raw_Quartz "Raw Quartz") in the inventory and delete the excess Portable Miners.
  * Build a Miner on the first Quartz node and connect it with power. Extend the Power Line from both Miners to the cave entrance and connect them to the main [Power grid](/wiki/Power_grid "Power grid").
  * Return to the base.
  * At the [MAM](/wiki/MAM "MAM"), look at the [Quartz Research](/wiki/Quartz_Research "Quartz Research"). 
    * Unlock all the way down to [Crystal Oscillator](/wiki/Crystal_Oscillator "Crystal Oscillator").
  * Build three temporary [Constructors](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor") crafting [Quartz Crystals](/wiki/Quartz_Crystal "Quartz Crystal") then connect both their inputs and outputs to [Storage Containers](/wiki/Storage_Container "Storage Container"). 
    * Once it is done, remove them.
  * Use all the [Quartz Crystals](/wiki/Quartz_Crystal "Quartz Crystal") to craft [Crystal Oscillators](/wiki/Crystal_Oscillator "Crystal Oscillator"), then [research](/wiki/Research "Research") Signal Technologies and Frequency Mapping. Wait for the research to complete. 
    * Do not unlock [Explorer](/wiki/Explorer "Explorer") yet. We do not have extra [Quartz](/wiki/Quartz "Quartz") for that.
  * Congratulations! The [Map](/wiki/Map "Map") is now unlocked. Press [`Z`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to use it.



### Resource Sink Bonus Program

  * Complete [Tier 2](/wiki/Tier_2 "Tier 2") \- Resource Sink Bonus Program.
  * Near [the HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB"), build a [Storage Container](/wiki/Storage_Container "Storage Container") connected to an [AWESOME Sink](/wiki/AWESOME_Sink "AWESOME Sink"). Provide [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") to the Sink.
  * Use the [Computer](/wiki/Computer "Computer") that we have looted from the [Crash Site](/wiki/Crash_Site "Crash Site") earlier, custom-split it [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right") and insert only two Computers into the Container. 
    * Items from the Container will be transported to the Sink and get destroyed. Points are rewarded according to the item's complexity. They are needed to print [FICSIT Coupons](/wiki/FICSIT_Coupon "FICSIT Coupon").
  * At the AWESOME Sink, click 'Print Coupons' and [`Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")+[](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") to take out the Coupons: 
    * Build an [AWESOME Shop](/wiki/AWESOME_Shop "AWESOME Shop").
    * Purchase Double Ramp Pack, Foundations Expansion Pack, and Walkways. The rest is up to your preference and availability of [Coupons](/wiki/Coupon "Coupon").
    * At the top right, click 'Cart' then 'Buy All'. New unlocked buildings can be found in the build menu.
    * Double Ramp snaps to each other without the need of building a Foundation in-between, which is much more convenient than a normal Ramp.



### Coal Power 2

  * Revisit the Coal Power. There are two more untapped [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal") nodes nearby. 
    * Use them to double up the [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") production to 1200 MW.
  * When constructing [Power Line](/wiki/Power_Line "Power Line") from an existing building or [Power Pole](/wiki/Power_Pole "Power Pole"), and if aimed at its endpoint on a ground, an additional [Power Pole](/wiki/Power_Pole "Power Pole") hologram is automatically included.
  * After click and confirm the building, a Power Pole will be built along with the Power Line. We can then aim the [Power Pole Mk.2](/wiki/Power_Pole_Mk.2 "Power Pole Mk.2") hologram at it to upgrade it in-place.
  * You don't have to prime this setup, just hook the Power Line to the main [power grid](/wiki/Power_grid "Power grid"). 
    * Same applies to all future Power extensions.
  * However, if your factory experiences a [power trip](/wiki/Power_trip "Power trip"), it might need to prime the entire system, using lots of [Biomass Burners](/wiki/Biomass_Burner "Biomass Burner"). 
    * During the priming process, disconnect the Power Line between the Power generation area and the main factory.
  * There is another Coal node on the hill opposite the river. We will reserve it for [Sulfur](/wiki/Sulfur "Sulfur") production chain later. 
    * Further reading: #Coal Power 3

  * Complete [Tier 2](/wiki/Tier_2 "Tier 2") \- [Jump Pad](/wiki/Jump_Pad "Jump Pad").



### Advanced Steel Production

  * From the base, scan for [Iron Ore](/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore"), then quickly scan for [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal"). Open the [Map](/wiki/Map "Map") [`Z`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") and look where both the Iron and Coal are located close together.
  * We wisest put up the [Steel](/wiki/Steel_Ingot "Steel Ingot") production there, on a floating platform.
  * Proceed to the location as shown below, position yourself between the Coal and Iron nodes.
  * Pick any rock or cliff as the anchor point and build a rectangular floating platform (minimum 10 x 15 foundations) that will be supporting our Steel production. 
    * The platform is to be positioned lower than the Coal node, but higher than the Iron node.
  * Build [Walkways](/wiki/Walkway "Walkway") or [Ramps](/wiki/Ramps "Ramps") as to provide access for climbing up.
  * The Coal nodes are on top of the grassy cliff. To reach them, build [Double Ramp 8m x 8m](/wiki/Double_Ramp_8m_x_8m "Double Ramp 8m x 8m") towards it.
  * Tap all three Coal nodes and lay [Conveyor Belts](/wiki/Conveyor_Belts "Conveyor Belts") down the ramp. 
    * Conveyor Belts can be built on top of each other or even on top of other [buildings](/wiki/Building "Building").
  * Tap all three pure Iron nodes. Use [Conveyor Lifts](/wiki/Conveyor_Lift "Conveyor Lift") to bring up the ores from the lower ground. 
    * Chain multiple Conveyor Lifts to span over large vertical distances.
    * Conveyor Lift can be snapped directly to a belt connector, whether it is on a machine, [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt"), [Splitter](/wiki/Splitter "Splitter"), [Merger](/wiki/Merger "Merger"), or another Conveyor Lift.
  * Build the starter Steel production as shown and connect all six input belts to the [Miners](/wiki/Miner "Miner").

  * Although it may look complex at the first sight, this is just a method of splitting 3 * 60 belts into 4 * 45 belts. 
    * Each belt segment is limited to 60 items/second.
  * Belts can be built intersect with each other without encroachment issue.
  * Once sufficient Steel Pipes are obtained, complete [Tier 4](/wiki/Tier_4 "Tier 4") \- Advanced Steel Production. 
    * While waiting for the Steel Pipes to pile up, search for more [Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug") until you have at least 12 [Power Shards](/wiki/Power_Shard "Power Shard") in hand.



### Logistics Mk.3

  * As there is no cooldown for the Advanced Steel Production milestone, proceed to unlock [Tier 4](/wiki/Tier_4 "Tier 4") \- Logistics Mk.3. 
    * Overwrite the hotkey [`3`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") with [Conveyor Belt Mk.3](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt_Mk.3 "Conveyor Belt Mk.3") for improved belt speed.
    * Notice that we have skipped [Conveyor Belt Mk.2](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt_Mk.2 "Conveyor Belt Mk.2") as [RIP](/wiki/RIP "RIP") is too expensive to be mass-produced.
    * Use [Conveyor Belt Mk.3](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt_Mk.3 "Conveyor Belt Mk.3") from now onwards.
    * As we are limited by the amount of [Steel Beam](/wiki/Steel_Beam "Steel Beam"), do not hurry to upgrade all existing [belts](/wiki/Belt "Belt") to Mk.3 until we have increased production of the Steel Beams.
  * Revisit Steel production area.
  * There are four [Constructors](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor") producing [Steel Pipes](/wiki/Steel_Pipe "Steel Pipe"), change one of those into Steel Beam, then dismantle the one beside it. 
    * Take note: a Steel Beam Constructor consumes 60 [Steel Ingots](/wiki/Steel_Ingot "Steel Ingot")/min.
  * There are two normal [Limestone](/wiki/Limestone "Limestone") nodes nearby; use them to produce [Concrete](/wiki/Concrete "Concrete"), then combine it with 15 [Steel Beam](/wiki/Steel_Beam "Steel Beam") / min to produce 3.75 [Encased Industrial Beam](/wiki/Encased_Industrial_Beam "Encased Industrial Beam") / min. 
    * [Underclock](/wiki/Underclock "Underclock") the [EIB](/wiki/EIB "EIB") [Assembler](/wiki/Assembler "Assembler") to 63%.



### Nobelisk Detonator

  * Scan for [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal") then proceed to the highlighted position in the map below. It is located opposite the river from the Coal Power.
  * Build a floating platform there and start the [Sulfur](/wiki/Sulfur "Sulfur") production chain.
  * Tap the pure Coal node, then move southeast into the misty [Northern Forest](/wiki/Northern_Forest "Northern Forest") until you see two yellowish, [Sulfur](/wiki/Sulfur "Sulfur") nodes.
  * Manually mine 60 [Sulfur](/wiki/Sulfur "Sulfur").
  * Tap both nodes and combine them into a single Mk.3 [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt"), then pull the belt back to the platform near the Coal node.
  * Build a [MAM](/wiki/MAM "MAM") then unlock Sulfur and [Black Powder](/wiki/Black_Powder "Black Powder").
  * Build six [Assemblers](/wiki/Assembler "Assembler") to produce 45 Black Powders/min and connect their output to a [Storage Container](/wiki/Storage_Container "Storage Container").
  * With the Black Powder, unlock [Nobelisk](/wiki/Nobelisk "Nobelisk") and [Nobelisk Detonator](/wiki/Nobelisk_Detonator "Nobelisk Detonator"). 
    * _Further reading:[Nobelisk Detonator](/wiki/Nobelisk_Detonator "Nobelisk Detonator")_
  * Continue to research the [Sulfur Research](/wiki/Sulfur_Research "Sulfur Research") Tree; lookout for those that expand [inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") and hand slots.


  * [](/wiki/File:Map_black_powder_location.png "Set up the Black Powder production at the area marked with the cyan rectangle. Bring Sulfur from the yellow circled area.")

### Vehicular Transport

  * Complete Milestone [Tier 3](/wiki/Tier_3 "Tier 3") \- Vehicular Transport, which unlocks [Tractor](/wiki/Tractor "Tractor") and [Truck Station](/wiki/Truck_Station "Truck Station").
  * We will not be using them in this guide, feel free to try them out yourself.



### Coal Power 3

  * We are going to further quadruple (actually, 4.5x) the existing Coal Power to 5400 MW. This will allow us to begin some large-scale production.
  * Add four [Miner Mk.2](/wiki/Miner_Mk.2 "Miner Mk.2"), 56 [Coal Generators](/wiki/Coal_Generator "Coal Generator"), and 22 [Water Extractors](/wiki/Water_Extractor "Water Extractor") to the [To Do List](/wiki/To_Do_List "To Do List"). 
    * You may need to travel multiple times due to the sheer amount of building material involved. Build some [Personal Storage Boxes](/wiki/Personal_Storage_Box "Personal Storage Box") at the construction site for storage.
  * Upgrade all four [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal") [Miners](/wiki/Miner "Miner") to Mk.2. The cost of the Mk.1 Miners will be refunded to you.
  * [Overclock](/wiki/Overclock "Overclock") all Miners to 225% for 270 Coal/min, which is equal to the throughput of [Conveyor Belt Mk.3](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt_Mk.3 "Conveyor Belt Mk.3"). Don't upgrade the belt yet.
  * As the water area around is limited, if we continue to expand using the same method, the water surface will soon be fully covered. 
    * This, in turn, reduces the number of [Water Extractors](/wiki/Water_Extractor "Water Extractor") we can build.
  * To conserve the water surface area, we will build a floating platform to house the new [Coal Generators](/wiki/Coal_Generator "Coal Generator") instead. We can then build Water Extractors below that. 
    * Alternatively, you may expand into the sea by simply copying the previous design. In that case, you can skip all the steps below. Remember to use Mk.3 [belts](/wiki/Belt "Belt").
  * Build two rows of [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations") and some [Pipeline Junction Crosses](/wiki/Pipeline_Junction_Cross "Pipeline Junction Cross") aligned with Water Extractors as shown below. [Junctions](/wiki/Junction "Junction") should be 20 meters apart, each row positioned three meters from the Foundation centerline. 
    * We will refer to these as the 'lower' platform. It should be positioned at least at the same height as the water level, or slightly above it; refer to the image below.
    * Temporarily build a [Lookout Tower](/wiki/Lookout_Tower "Lookout Tower") and stand on it for easier placement of Water Extractors.
  * As a [Water Extractor](/wiki/Water_Extractor "Water Extractor") is 17 meters high, we need to build the floating platform at least 18 meters above the lower floor (17-meter clearance + one meter [Glass Foundation](/wiki/Glass_Foundation "Glass Foundation") thickness). 
    * If you wish to use [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations") with more than 1-meter thickness, you may need to raise them further to achieve the 17-meter vertical clearance.
  * From the ground foundation, stack nine [Foundation 8m x 2m](/wiki/Foundation_8m_x_2m "Foundation 8m x 2m") vertically as a temporary support/measurement. Build an 8 x 12 platform from there, then build a [Jump Pad](/wiki/Jump_Pad "Jump Pad") to go up.
  * Remove the temporary support and build a [U-Jelly Landing Pad](/wiki/U-Jelly_Landing_Pad "U-Jelly Landing Pad") nearby. [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") both the Jelly and the Jump Pad. 
    * When falling from above, land on the green jelly part of the Landing Pad. Adjust the position of the Landing Pad where necessary.
    * Pioneers receive no fall damage when falling onto the U-Jelly Landing Pad or deep water.
    * Be creative as there are many options for vertical travel.
  * Place two rows of eight Coal Generators each on the floating platform as shown. Opposing generators should be aligned based on their belt connector's position.
  * Connect [Pipelines](/wiki/Pipelines "Pipelines") in groups of four Coal Generators each.
  * Connect all Coal Generators with [Conveyor Belt Mk.3](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt_Mk.3 "Conveyor Belt Mk.3").


  * [](/wiki/File:Foundation_sea_level.png "Building Foundations on the sea level. If the water covers the foundation, move up the foundation such that it is positioned above the water level.")

Using [Jump Pad](/wiki/Jump_Pad "Jump Pad") and [U-Jelly Landing Pad](/wiki/U-Jelly_Landing_Pad "U-Jelly Landing Pad") as a way to travel vertically.

  * [](/wiki/File:Coal_Generator_Manifold_2.png "Connect all Coal Generators to the same belt. Connect them with pipes, four in each group.")

Connect all [Coal Generators](/wiki/Coal_Generator "Coal Generator") to the same [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt"). Connect them with [pipes](/wiki/Pipe "Pipe"), four in each group.



  * Move outside the setup, build a Lookout Tower nearby, and climb onto it. From there, build a [pipe](/wiki/Pipe "Pipe") from the end of the lower pipe to the end of the upper pipe using Vertical Build mode. 
    * While building, press [`R`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to cycle through different [build modes](/wiki/Pipeline#Build_mode "Pipeline").
    * In vertical build mode, the vertical part is always generated at the endpoint. If you build in reverse, you will get the encroachment warning.
    * Pipelines can clip through Foundations, Belts, and other Pipelines.
    * Repeat for all four endpoints of the pipe, for a total of four riser pipes.
  * [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") the Water Extractors and the Coal Generators. Do not rush to connect the belt from a Coal Miner; we will focus on the pipes first.
  * Let the Water Extractors run for a while, then interact [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") with the lower Pipelines and the upper Pipelines to check their status: 
    * The lower Pipelines are mostly full of [Water](/wiki/Water "Water"), while the upper Pipelines are empty. This is due to insufficient head lift.
    * 'Head lift' refers to a [building](/wiki/Building "Building")'s ability to push [fluid](/wiki/Fluid "Fluid") upwards.
    * Most buildings with a pipe output (including Water Extractor) have a head lift of 10 meters. [Pipeline Pumps](/wiki/Pipeline_Pump "Pipeline Pump") have 20 meters of head lift.
    * The head lift is counted from the preceding building/pump center point. The effect of head lift does not stack.
    * As the vertical pipe is 18 meters high, one [Pipeline Pump](/wiki/Pipeline_Pump "Pipeline Pump") is sufficient for each vertical pipe.
  * Pick a riser pipe (the vertical part of a pipe) and build a [Pipeline Pump](/wiki/Pipeline_Pump "Pipeline Pump") near its lower part. 
    * Rotate the Pump's hologram and make sure its arrow is pointed upwards (the back of the pump pistons will point down). Power the pump.
  * Check if the upper Pipeline is receiving Water. If not, check the Pump's placement.
  * Build Pumps to all remaining riser pipes and make sure they are all working. 
    * You can check the upper pipe's fluid content even when standing below, as the [Glass Foundation](/wiki/Glass_Foundation "Glass Foundation") is transparent. There are flow indicators at the center of each long pipeline.
    * _Further reading:[Pipeline#Flow Indicator](/wiki/Pipeline#Flow_Indicator "Pipeline")_
  * Pick one of the [Miners](/wiki/Miner "Miner"), disconnect it from the existing Coal Power, and divert the belt to the new Coal Power setup. Use [Conveyor Belt Mk.3](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt_Mk.3 "Conveyor Belt Mk.3").
  * A Coal Generator consumes up to 15 [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal")/min, and we have 16 of them. As `15 x 16 = 240 Coal /min`, we can still add two more Coal Generators to the end of line to fully utilize the 270/min of the Mk.3 belt.
  * Add two more Coal Generators, then add a Water Extractor and a Pipeline Pump. Connect them with a 5th Pipeline. Connect all the infrastructure. 
    * 'Infrastructure' refers to Belt, Pipe, and Power Connections.
  * Climb onto one of the Coal Generators and check if all the Coal Generators' [Indicator Lights](/wiki/Indicator_Light "Indicator Light") are green. If any of them show red, check their connection.
  * Once it is up and running, build three more copies of these, let them run, then dismantle the old Coal Power.
  * The [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") capacity is now 5400 MW. (`4 * 18 * 75 MW = 5400 MW`)


  * [](/wiki/File:Pipe_Vertical_Build_Mode.png "Use Vertical Build mode R to connect a Pipeline. The head lift of a straight vertical pipe is easier to manage compared to a slanting pipe.")

### Steel Production 2

  * Revisit the Steel production area.
  * There is one unused normal [Limestone](/wiki/Limestone "Limestone") node and one pure Copper node nearby. Tap them both. 
    * We have three [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal") [Miners](/wiki/Miner "Miner"), three Iron Miners, three Limestone Miners, and one Copper Miner here.
    * Overclock all Miners such that each of them produces 270 / min. Collect more [Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug") to craft [Power Shards](/wiki/Power_Shard "Power Shard").
    * You can collect [Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug") after building the factory—there is no rush to do it now.
  * Dismantle the current Steel production. Store the excess material in [Personal Storage Boxes](/wiki/Personal_Storage_Box "Personal Storage Box"). Expand the platform to 28 x 23. 
    * If you run out of building space, build more [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations").
  * We will build a [Hyper Tube](/wiki/Hyper_Tube "Hyper Tube") to move up and down the platform: 
    * Build a [Hyper Tube Support](/wiki/Hyper_Tube_Support "Hyper Tube Support") at the edge of the platform.
    * Build a Hyper Tube from the upper Hyper Tube Support and click its endpoint at the ground. Another Hyper Tube Support will be automatically added at the end.
    * Build a [Hyper Tube Entrance](/wiki/Hyper_Tube_Entrance "Hyper Tube Entrance") at both ends of the Hyper Tube and [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") both of them.
  * Optional: Build another long Hyper Tube, connecting the base and the Steel production area.
  * Use an Online Calculator to adjust the target production such that it does not exceed both the Coal and Iron mining capability. 
    * Based on the surrounding nodes, the mining rates are Coal: 810/min, Iron Ore: 810/min, Copper Ore: 270/min, Limestone: 450/min.
    * _Further reading:[Tools](/wiki/Tools "Tools")_
  * Setup the improved Steel production area as shown: 
    * If you have unlocked [Alternate: Solid Steel Ingot](/wiki/Steel_Ingot "Steel Ingot") from [Hard Drive](/wiki/Hard_Drive "Hard Drive"), go ahead and use the alternate recipe. It is more resource-effective.
    * In this guide, we will stick to the original recipe, at least until [Tier 6](/wiki/Tier_6 "Tier 6").
  * Observe that some of the Limestone capacity is not fully utilized. In that case, remove the [Power Shards](/wiki/Power_Shard "Power Shard") from the Miners for later use.
  * For crossing a belt over a congested area, build [Conveyor Lifts](/wiki/Conveyor_Lift "Conveyor Lift") at both sides to form an elevated 'bridge'. 
    * You can also use [Stackable Conveyor Pole](/wiki/Stackable_Conveyor_Pole "Stackable Conveyor Pole").
    * Alternatively, you can bring it to a lower level. This requires a lower platform to be built below.
  * Bring the [Steel Pipe](/wiki/Steel_Pipe "Steel Pipe"), [Steel Beam](/wiki/Steel_Beam "Steel Beam"), [EIB](/wiki/EIB "EIB"), [Stator](/wiki/Stator "Stator"), and [Automated Wiring](/wiki/Automated_Wiring "Automated Wiring") back to the base with [belts](/wiki/Belt "Belt"). Build [Industrial Storage Containers](/wiki/Industrial_Storage_Container "Industrial Storage Container") at the base, not at the Steel production area.
  * Bring the [Black Powder](/wiki/Black_Powder "Black Powder") back to the base and automate the production of [Nobelisk](/wiki/Nobelisk "Nobelisk").

### Project Assembly - Framework

  * To complete 'Project Assembly - Framework', we need more [Smart Plating](/wiki/Smart_Plating "Smart Plating"), [Versatile Framework](/wiki/Versatile_Framework "Versatile Framework"), and [Automated Wiring](/wiki/Automated_Wiring "Automated Wiring"). 
    * We dismantled the [Smart Plating](/wiki/Smart_Plating "Smart Plating") production earlier. Now we have to rebuild it but on a larger scale.
    * We have [Steel Beams](/wiki/Steel_Beam "Steel Beam") readily available for [Versatile Frameworks](/wiki/Versatile_Framework "Versatile Framework").
    * We have [Automated Wiring](/wiki/Automated_Wiring "Automated Wiring") automated, and its production rate is even sufficient for the subsequent delivery: Project Assembly - Systems.
  * There are four pure and three normal Iron nodes supplying the base; upgrade all of them to [Miner Mk.2](/wiki/Miner_Mk.2 "Miner Mk.2") and [overclock](/wiki/Overclock "Overclock") all each of them to 270 / min. 
    * This increases the [Iron Ore](/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore") mining rate to 1890 / min. (`7 * 270 = 1890`)
    * Build the factory first; [Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug") can be collected later for the overclocking.
  * Use Daniel's Calculator[4] to generate the below diagram, and build accordingly. 
    * Add whatever [Alternate Recipes](/wiki/Alternate_Recipe "Alternate Recipe") you have unlocked into the calculator; the result might differ from below, but will definitely be more resource-efficient.
  * First, revamp the Iron production. Build a large platform (45 x 30). 
    * Be creative. It is not necessary to build everything on the same floor like the example below; you can make it more compact by splitting and stacking the factory into multiple floors or even create 'mezzanine' floors in-between. Take note: different buildings have different hitbox heights.
    * Cut down any tree that penetrates the platform.
    * If the [Space Elevator](/wiki/Space_Elevator "Space Elevator") is in the way, relocate [`F`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") it to somewhere else.
    * Before the new factory is up and running, do not dismantle the old factory. It is still useful to produce the building material that we might require during the process.
  * From now on, use [Industrial Storage Container](/wiki/Industrial_Storage_Container "Industrial Storage Container") instead of [Storage Container](/wiki/Storage_Container "Storage Container") to store end products. 
    * Alternatively, multiple Storage Containers can be stacked on each other and be chained with [Conveyor Lifts](/wiki/Conveyor_Lift "Conveyor Lift") to act as larger storage.
  * Do not expect this setup to be completed in one go. Take it slowly and separate the construction into a few days. 
    * When designing a compact factory layout, think about how to keep the [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt") length to a minimum.
    * Main bus designs may look cooler, but modular layouts have shorter belt lengths, which in turn saves building material and reduces the footprint.
    * 'Main bus' refers to the parallel belts that act as a material highway. 'Modular' refers to a small cluster of buildings that are functional as a module and they are easily expandable by repeating the layout.
  * Examples of a modular factory: 
    * [Screws](/wiki/Screw "Screw") and [Iron Ingots](/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot") are consumed in large amounts. To minimize belt usage, build the next factory that requires them nearby. For Iron Ingot to [Iron Rod](/wiki/Iron_Rod "Iron Rod"), the [Smelter](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter") to [Constructor](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor") ratio is 1:2. For Iron Ingot to [Iron Plate](/wiki/Iron_Plate "Iron Plate"), the Smelter to Constructor ratio is 1:1.
    * Screws to [Rotor](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor") building ratio is 2:5; that means build five Constructors in a group, then split their output into two [Assemblers](/wiki/Assembler "Assembler"). For Screws to [RIP](/wiki/RIP "RIP"), it is three Constructors: two Assemblers.
  * The advised building sequence is: 
    * Build a small module of buildings; put down some Splitters, Mergers, and Power Poles to test the building placement. Once you are satisfied with the modular design, proceed to mass-construction.
    * Build the factory buildings first; leave plenty of space between clusters.
    * Set the building recipes.
    * Build [Splitters](/wiki/Splitter "Splitter") and [Mergers](/wiki/Merger "Merger") and connect the [belts](/wiki/Belt "Belt"). Construct flyover belts where necessary.
    * Build [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") and [Power Lines](/wiki/Power_Line "Power Line").
    * Check if all the [Indicator Light](/wiki/Indicator_Light "Indicator Light") are green and troubleshoot the faults.
  * When connecting infrastructure (such as belts, [pipes](/wiki/Pipe "Pipe"), and power), follow the sequence of crafting steps. 
    * For example, start from [Miner](/wiki/Miner "Miner"), then Smelter, etc. That way, as you complete the current building connections, the input belt will be filled up with material from previous factories.
  * Produce [Versatile Framework](/wiki/Versatile_Framework "Versatile Framework") and [Motor](/wiki/Motor "Motor") as shown below.
  * Centralize the storage area by putting them close together, with at least one [Industrial Storage Container](/wiki/Industrial_Storage_Container "Industrial Storage Container") storing each kind of item. Relocate the [HUB](/wiki/HUB "HUB") there. 
    * [Conveyor Lifts](/wiki/Conveyor_Lift "Conveyor Lift") are used to bring down the items from higher floors to the ground.
    * To 'label' a storage building, build a short [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt") from its output, as shown in an image below.
  * While waiting for the [Space Elevator](/wiki/Space_Elevator "Space Elevator")'s material, collect more [Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug") and craft them into [Power Shards](/wiki/Power_Shard "Power Shard"), then overclock the Miners accordingly.

## Tier 5 and Tier 6

  * Congratulations, you have unlocked [Tier 5](/wiki/Tier_5 "Tier 5") and [Tier 6](/wiki/Tier_6 "Tier 6")!
  * Look at the [Space Elevator](/wiki/Space_Elevator "Space Elevator") to check the requirements for the next (and, currently, the final) delivery: Project Assembly - Systems.
  * Our next long-term target is to collect enough [Hard Drives](/wiki/Hard_Drive "Hard Drive") around the [world](/wiki/World "World") to unlock all available [Alternate Recipes](/wiki/Alternate_Recipes "Alternate Recipes") before further expanding our factory. 
    * _Further reading:[Alternate Recipes](/wiki/Alternate_Recipes "Alternate Recipes")_
  * Oil processing is the key component for Tier 5 and 6. Before we unlock the alternate recipes, we will first set up a temporary, inefficient factory with a lot of wastage, but still enough for bootstrapping the [Plastic](/wiki/Plastic "Plastic") and [Rubber](/wiki/Rubber "Rubber") production. Later on, we will construct a more efficient Oil processing factory.
  * Getting more [Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug") is becoming more challenging as the Power Slugs around the starting area have been exhausted, forcing you to travel further. Luckily, Power Slugs are renewable, provided you have tamed at least a [Lizard Doggo](/wiki/Lizard_Doggo "Lizard Doggo").
  * Before moving on, build a temporary [Assembler](/wiki/Assembler "Assembler") crafting [A.I. Limiter](/wiki/A.I._Limiter "A.I. Limiter") using [Quickwire](/wiki/Quickwire "Quickwire") and [Copper Sheet](/wiki/Copper_Sheet "Copper Sheet"), then underclock it to 30%. 
    * Research [Smart Splitter](/wiki/Smart_Splitter "Smart Splitter") in the [MAM](/wiki/MAM "MAM").



### Taming a Lizard Doggo

  * This section is optional, but it can be helpful for generating [Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug").
  * Unlock [Fence](/wiki/Fence "Fence") at the [AWESOME Shop](/wiki/AWESOME_Shop "AWESOME Shop") by [sinking](/wiki/Sink "Sink") some [Motors](/wiki/Motor "Motor"), [Versatile Frameworks](/wiki/Versatile_Framework "Versatile Framework"), and [Automated Wiring](/wiki/Automated_Wiring "Automated Wiring"). 
    * 'Sinking' refers to the act of putting items onto a belt that feeds into [AWESOME Sink](/wiki/AWESOME_Sink "AWESOME Sink"), either directly from factory buildings or via a [Storage Container](/wiki/Storage_Container "Storage Container").
    * Take note: items cannot be directly dispensed onto a [Conveyor Belt](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt "Conveyor Belt") via manual interaction. Dropped items will simply remain stationary.
    * Do not sink [Computers](/wiki/Computer "Computer") that you have looted from [Crash Sites](/wiki/Crash_Site "Crash Site"); they will be used later.
  * Before taming a [](/wiki/Lizard_Doggo "Lizard Doggo") [Lizard Doggo](/wiki/Lizard_Doggo "Lizard Doggo"), build a Lizard Doggo pen near [the HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB") using Fences and [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations").
  * Bring some [Paleberry](/wiki/Paleberry "Paleberry") with you. Do not eat them as they are the bait for Lizard Doggos. 
    * Paleberries can be found around grassy biomes, such as near the Coal Power area.
  * Look around until you find a Lizard Doggo. When it stares at you, stop moving. 
    * If you are in the running mode, press [`⇧ Shift`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to toggle it to walking mode.
    * Un-equip the [Blade Runners](/wiki/Blade_Runners "Blade Runners").
    * If the [pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer") jumps too high or run too far from the Lizard Doggos, they will flee.
  * Open [Inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory"). Hold down [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right") on the [Paleberry](/wiki/Paleberry "Paleberry") to custom split one of it from its [stack](/wiki/Stack "Stack"). Drag one Paleberry outside the Inventory window to drop it.
  * Wait until the Lizard Doggo comes over and eats the [berry](/wiki/Berry "Berry"). Do not move, just look at it.
  * After it eats the berry, look at it and interact [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to pet it; this will tame the Lizard Doggo. 
    * As long as you pet the Lizard Doggo after it eats the Berry but before it leaves the spot, the taming probability is 100%.
  * Interact [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") with Doggo again will open up its inventory window, displaying only one empty slot at the left. The pioneer's inventory is at the right. 
    * When the Lizard Doggo finds something, the item generated will be displayed in this single slot.
  * Close its inventory window [`Esc`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). Closing with the top-right 'X' is glitchy, as it will not close the UI properly.
  * Press [`⇧ Shift`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to toggle back to running mode.
  * Bring the Lizard Doggo back to the pen, and make sure it is following you. 
    * Low-lying [Conveyor Belts](/wiki/Conveyor_Belts "Conveyor Belts") and other structures can block Lizard Doggos' movement. Temporarily dismantle the obstructions where required.
    * Lizard Doggos cannot jump. When traversing cliffs or ravines, walkways or ramps might be required for Lizard Doggos to cross over.
  * Lure the Lizard Doggo to the floating foundation above the pen, then dismantle the floating foundation to trap it in the pen.
  * The Blade Runners can now be re-equipped.
  * From time to time, random items will be generated, including [Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug"). Check them out regularly (by interacting with Lizard Doggo). 
    * _Read[Lizard Doggo](/wiki/Lizard_Doggo "Lizard Doggo") for a list of generated items_.
    * The best item they can generate is [Purple Power Slugs](/wiki/Purple_Power_Slug "Purple Power Slug").
  * Sometimes the Lizard Doggos might forget their owner. Re-tame them if that happens.
  * There are lots of Lizard Doggos around the [world](/wiki/World "World"); try to tame them all.

### Oil Processing

  * Unlock [Tier 5](/wiki/Tier_5 "Tier 5") \- Oil Processing.



### Fluid Packaging

  * Most [Tier 5](/wiki/Tier_5 "Tier 5") Milestones require [Plastic](/wiki/Plastic "Plastic") and [Rubber](/wiki/Rubber "Rubber"), which are both refined from [Crude Oil](/wiki/Crude_Oil "Crude Oil").
  * Add four [Oil Extractors](/wiki/Oil_Extractor "Oil Extractor") and two [Refineries](/wiki/Refineries "Refineries") to the [To Do List](/wiki/To_Do_List "To Do List").
  * Scan [`V`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") for [Crude Oil](/wiki/Crude_Oil "Crude Oil"). The scan results show that they are nowhere near the base; the nearest is 1.6 km away.
  * We will use the Oil nodes to the southwest.
  * Beyond the To Do List, prepare: 
    * [Iron Rod](/wiki/Iron_Rod "Iron Rod"), [Iron Plate](/wiki/Iron_Plate "Iron Plate"), [Concrete](/wiki/Concrete "Concrete"), [Cable](/wiki/Cable "Cable"): minimum three [stacks](/wiki/Stack "Stack") each.
    * [Wire](/wiki/Wire "Wire"), [Quickwire](/wiki/Quickwire "Quickwire"), [Solid Biofuel](/wiki/Solid_Biofuel "Solid Biofuel"), [RIP](/wiki/RIP "RIP"), [Rotor](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor"), [Motor](/wiki/Motor "Motor"), [Modular Frame](/wiki/Modular_Frame "Modular Frame"), [Steel Beam](/wiki/Steel_Beam "Steel Beam"), [Steel Pipe](/wiki/Steel_Pipe "Steel Pipe"), [EIB](/wiki/EIB "EIB"), [Nobelisk](/wiki/Nobelisk "Nobelisk"): minimum one stack each
    * [Blade Runners](/wiki/Blade_Runners "Blade Runners"), [Xeno-Basher](/wiki/Xeno-Basher "Xeno-Basher"), [Beryl Nuts](/wiki/Beryl_Nut "Beryl Nut"), [Nobelisk Detonator](/wiki/Nobelisk_Detonator "Nobelisk Detonator"), [Chainsaw](/wiki/Chainsaw "Chainsaw"), [Object Scanner](/wiki/Object_Scanner "Object Scanner")
  * As we are extending the [Power grid](/wiki/Power_grid "Power grid") there, bring extra Cables and Concrete.
  * There are [Flying Crab Hatchers](/wiki/Flying_Crab_Hatcher "Flying Crab Hatcher") and [Alpha Spitters](/wiki/Alpha_Spitter "Alpha Spitter") guarding the oilpatch; approach with care. 
    * Save the game.
  * Head to the southwest Oil patch. As the [Resource Scanner](/wiki/Resource_Scanner "Resource Scanner") search result only lasts for 25 seconds, re-scan if the Oil icon disappears from the [compass](/wiki/Compass "Compass").
  * Build [Power Lines](/wiki/Power_Line "Power Line") as you move.
  * The Oil nodes are located on the [islands](/wiki/Islands "Islands"). Use [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations") or [Walkways](/wiki/Walkway "Walkway") to build a path across the sea, as swimming is relatively slow. 
    * While swimming, make sure the [Blade Runners](/wiki/Blade_Runners "Blade Runners") are equipped and keep jumping on the water surface for optimum movement speed.
  * Save the game once you land on the islands.
  * There are four Oil nodes there; kill all the creatures guarding them. Build an [Oil Extractor](/wiki/Oil_Extractor "Oil Extractor") on top of each Oil node and [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") them.
  * Pick any Oil Extractor and connect it to two [Refineries](/wiki/Refineries "Refineries") with [pipes](/wiki/Pipe "Pipe") and a [Junction](/wiki/Junction "Junction"), both crafting [Plastic](/wiki/Plastic "Plastic"). You don't have to connect the Refineries' outputs. 
    * Provide Power to the Refineries as well.
    * A [Pipeline Junction Cross](/wiki/Pipeline_Junction_Cross "Pipeline Junction Cross") can be built at the middle of an existing Pipeline by snapping its hologram at the pipe.


  * [](/wiki/File:Bootstrap_plastic_schematic.png "A temporary setup for getting our first 200 Plastics. Dismantle the Refineries after 200 Plastics are produced. Keep the Oil Extractor.")

  * Add a Map Marker here by opening the [Map](/wiki/Map "Map"), clicking "New Map Marker", and selecting the location of this oil outpost. 
    * Enter a name for the marker; let's name it 'Oil'. Customize its color and icon.
    * Change the compass view distance to 'Infinite'.
  * Look around the [Islands](/wiki/Islands "Islands"); if there are [Spore Flowers](/wiki/Spore_Flower "Spore Flower") in the way, remove them with a [Nobelisk Detonator](/wiki/Nobelisk_Detonator "Nobelisk Detonator").
  * Find an open space nearby, preferably on the open sea, then build a platform (size 38 x 14) at sea level.
  * There are some [Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug") nearby. Use them to [overclock](/wiki/Overclock "Overclock") all Oil Extractors to 300 m3/min. 
    * Oil Extractors should not be overclocked beyond 300 m3/min as that is the maximum flow rate of a [Pipeline](/wiki/Pipeline "Pipeline").
  * Optional: At the mainland East of the Oil [Islands](/wiki/Islands "Islands") is a large cave; scout the area and scavenge the Power Slugs, [Computers](/wiki/Computer "Computer") and other material laying around.
  * Take out 200 [Plastics](/wiki/Plastic "Plastic") from the Refineries and dismantle them.
  * Go back to [the HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB") and complete [Tier 5](/wiki/Tier_5 "Tier 5") \- Fluid Packaging.



### Industrial Manufacturing

  * Add 28 [Refineries](/wiki/Refinery "Refinery"), five [Packagers](/wiki/Packager "Packager") four [Constructors](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor"), and one [AWESOME Sink](/wiki/AWESOME_Sink "AWESOME Sink") to the [To Do List](/wiki/To_Do_List "To Do List"). Bring extra [Copper Sheets](/wiki/Copper_Sheet "Copper Sheet") for constructing [Pipelines](/wiki/Pipelines "Pipelines").
  * It will take multiple trips to bring the necessary material there. If you have the [Tractor](/wiki/Tractor "Tractor") unlocked, try to use it. 
    * _Further reading:[Tractor](/wiki/Tractor "Tractor")_
  * By referring to the [Beacon](/wiki/Beacon "Beacon") labeled 'Oil' on the [compass](/wiki/Compass "Compass"), go back to the Oil [Islands](/wiki/Islands "Islands"). 
    * Following a built [Power Line](/wiki/Power_Line "Power Line") is another way to trace your destination, provided you have constructed it during the previous trip.
  * Build the setup as shown below.
  * Building tips: 
    * Try to build [Pipelines](/wiki/Pipelines "Pipelines") at about the same level as the source building's (for example, [Oil Extractor](/wiki/Oil_Extractor "Oil Extractor")) pipe outlet. This eliminates the need for [Pipeline Pumps](/wiki/Pipeline_Pump "Pipeline Pump").
    * Do not exceed the flow rate limit of a Pipeline, which is 300 m3/min. Split a Pipeline into multiple lines where required. A similar principle applies to [belts](/wiki/Belt "Belt").
    * In a [Constructor](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor"), when setting recipes such as [Empty Canister](/wiki/Empty_Canister "Empty Canister"), it can be difficult as it is positioned at the bottom of the list. Collapse the Constructor's 'Select Recipe' list by clicking the '-' at the right side of each category.
    * When constructing [Junctions](/wiki/Junction "Junction"), place one first, then hop onto it. It is easier to build Junctions when standing on a higher elevation. Build the next Junction, then hop onto it, and repeat the process. The same technique applies to [Splitters](/wiki/Splitter "Splitter") and [Mergers](/wiki/Merger "Merger").
    * Buildings such as the [Refinery](/wiki/Refinery "Refinery") have multiple guidelines (the Turquoise line when you place another building nearby): Building center line, Belt connector line, Pipe connector line, etc. Be sure to distinguish them properly.
  * Craft an [A.I. Limiter](/wiki/A.I._Limiter "A.I. Limiter") and build a [Smart Splitter](/wiki/Smart_Splitter "Smart Splitter") at the [Packaged Fuel](/wiki/Packaged_Fuel "Packaged Fuel")'s output belt, with an _Any_ output connected to a local [Industrial Storage Container](/wiki/Industrial_Storage_Container "Industrial Storage Container") and an _Overflow_ output connected to an [AWESOME Sink](/wiki/AWESOME_Sink "AWESOME Sink"). 
    * _Read[Smart Splitter](/wiki/Smart_Splitter "Smart Splitter") for configuration details._
    * A Refinery stops working if any of its output slots are full. Sinking the excess Packaged Fuel will ensure the [Heavy Oil Residue](/wiki/Heavy_Oil_Residue "Heavy Oil Residue") a.k.a. [HOR](/wiki/HOR "HOR") will never have a chance to clog up the [Plastic](/wiki/Plastic "Plastic") and [Rubber](/wiki/Rubber "Rubber") production.
  * After the building is completed, pull the Plastic and Rubber [belts](/wiki/Belt "Belt") back to the base. 
    * Before returning to base, take 300 [Packaged Fuel](/wiki/Packaged_Fuel "Packaged Fuel") with you to use as fuel for [Vehicles](/wiki/Vehicles "Vehicles").
    * When laying a long belt, it is advised to elevate them by extending the height of the [Conveyor Poles](/wiki/Conveyor_Pole "Conveyor Pole"). This will minimize potential obstructions for other tasks such as bringing a [Lizard Doggo](/wiki/Lizard_Doggo "Lizard Doggo") home.
    * To build a tall Conveyor Pole, first click its hologram on the ground, then move up the mouse before clicking the second time.
  * Near the base, build Industrial Storage Containers at the end of the Plastic and Rubber belts.
  * Complete [Tier 5](/wiki/Tier_5 "Tier 5") \- Industrial Manufacturing.

### Expanded Power Infrastructure

  * At least 14 meters above the Iron production, build another floating platform (22 x 15). 
    * This creates a 13-meter clearance which is sufficient for most of the buildings such as [Constructors](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor"), [Assemblers](/wiki/Assembler "Assembler"), and [Manufacturers](/wiki/Manufacturer "Manufacturer").
  * Setup the bootstrap factory for [Heavy Modular Frame](/wiki/Heavy_Modular_Frame "Heavy Modular Frame") followed by [Computer](/wiki/Computer "Computer") as shown below. 
    * We need Heavy Modular Frame a.k.a. [HMF](/wiki/HMF "HMF") to build [Manufacturers](/wiki/Manufacturer "Manufacturer"). They can be looted from [Crash Sites](/wiki/Crash_Site "Crash Site") or crafted manually.
    * HMF can be easily automated with materials in storage, as we have an excess of each ingredient automated.
    * Once the Computer production is up, revamp the Copper and Caterium productions as shown below. This is for preparing for the [Supercomputer](/wiki/Supercomputer "Supercomputer") production in the coming section.
    * We have 270 excess [Screws](/wiki/Screw "Screw")/min from the Iron production. Split them to feed both the HMF and Computer production lines.
    * The recipe for crafting [High-Speed Connector](/wiki/High-Speed_Connector "High-Speed Connector") can be researched at the [MAM](/wiki/MAM "MAM").
  * [Underclock](/wiki/Underclock "Underclock") the Manufacturers as shown to prevent them from consuming all the upstream material (Screws, [Cables](/wiki/Cable "Cable"), etc).
  * Dismantle the old Copper and Caterium production lines after completing this setup. Their [Containers](/wiki/Container "Container") are probably full; do not dismantle those Containers.
  * Observe the [Copper Ore](/wiki/Copper_Ore "Copper Ore") and [Copper Ingot](/wiki/Copper_Ingot "Copper Ingot") item flow rate is more than 270/min; this exceeds the Mk.3 [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt")'s capacity. We will solve the problem by upgrading those belts to Mk.4 later.
  * Use a [Smart Splitter](/wiki/Smart_Splitter "Smart Splitter") to prioritize supplying the Computer and [HSC](/wiki/HSC "HSC") Manufacturers by hooking up the [Circuit Board](/wiki/Circuit_Board "Circuit Board") storage to an _Overflow_ output.

  * Complete [Tier 6](/wiki/Tier_6 "Tier 6") \- Expanded Power Infrastructure.
  * Replace the hotkey four with [Conveyor Belt Mk.4](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt_Mk.4 "Conveyor Belt Mk.4"). From now on, build with Mk.4 belts, as they have much higher capacity. The same applies to [Conveyor Lift Mk.4](/wiki/Conveyor_Lift_Mk.4 "Conveyor Lift Mk.4").
  * Replace the Copper ore and Copper ingot [belts](/wiki/Belt "Belt") with Mk.4 to increase the allowed item rate from 270/min to 480/min.



### Jetpack

  * Complete [Tier 6](/wiki/Tier_6 "Tier 6") \- Jetpack. 
    * Craft a [Jetpack](/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack") and try using it to fly around. Make sure you have [Packaged Fuel](/wiki/Packaged_Fuel "Packaged Fuel") in [inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory"). Useful for collecting [Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug") and exploring [Crash Sites](/wiki/Crash_Site "Crash Site").
  * Sink extra [Computer](/wiki/Computer "Computer") and [HMF](/wiki/HMF "HMF") to unlock more [Walls](/wiki/Walls "Walls") / [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations") / special [vehicles](/wiki/Vehicles "Vehicles") at the [AWESOME Shop](/wiki/AWESOME_Shop "AWESOME Shop"). Do not buy any [Statues](/wiki/Statue "Statue") yet. 
    * _For a list of items and their Sink Points,[read here](/wiki/AWESOME_Sink "AWESOME Sink")._



### Manufacturing 1

  * Unlock [Supercomputer](/wiki/Supercomputer "Supercomputer"), [Fabric](/wiki/Fabric "Fabric"), [Rifle](/wiki/Rifle "Rifle"), and [Cartridge](/wiki/Cartridge "Cartridge") at the [MAM](/wiki/MAM "MAM").
  * Craft a [Rifle](/wiki/Rifle "Rifle") for future use.
  * Automate the following items with [Manufacturers](/wiki/Manufacturer "Manufacturer"): 
    * [Adaptive Control Unit](/wiki/Adaptive_Control_Unit "Adaptive Control Unit"), [Modular Engine](/wiki/Modular_Engine "Modular Engine"), [Supercomputer](/wiki/Supercomputer "Supercomputer"), [Beacon](/wiki/Beacon "Beacon"), [Rifle Cartridge](/wiki/Rifle_Cartridge "Rifle Cartridge"), in mentioned order.
    * For Rifle Cartridge production, use a separate [Copper Ore](/wiki/Copper_Ore "Copper Ore") belt (the 2nd Copper Node that you have tapped from the West).
  * We only ever need 100 Adaptive Control Units (ACU) - or two [stacks](/wiki/Stack "Stack") of it. To prevent overproduction, and thus consuming the Computers and HMFs, fill all slots in its output [Storage Container](/wiki/Storage_Container "Storage Container") except one with other items such as [Concrete](/wiki/Concrete "Concrete"). Split [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right") a stack of Concrete to fill up many slots, as shown below.
  * Tips to build a compact Manufacturer [Manifold](/wiki/Manifold "Manifold"): 
    * Build Manufacturers in a row, then stack several [Splitters](/wiki/Splitter "Splitter") in a ladder-pattern, one [Foundation](/wiki/Foundation "Foundation") away from the Manufacturer. Splitters should face the same direction, either all-left or all-right.
    * Dismantle unused Splitters. Connect them with horizontal [belts](/wiki/Belt "Belt").
    * Connect the Splitters and the Manufacturer with belts and [Conveyor Lifts](/wiki/Conveyor_Lift "Conveyor Lift").
    * Check if all ingredients are flowing into each Manufacturer.
    * Alternatively, we can build all these in 2D - place all Splitters on the same level, similar to what we did for [Assemblers](/wiki/Assembler "Assembler").
  * Do not be afraid to build spaghetti as this setup is temporary.
  * Connect a belt between the [Versatile Framework](/wiki/Versatile_Framework "Versatile Framework") and the [Space Elevator](/wiki/Space_Elevator "Space Elevator"). 
    * You don't have to belt the [Modular Engine](/wiki/Modular_Engine "Modular Engine") and [Adaptive Control Unit](/wiki/Adaptive_Control_Unit "Adaptive Control Unit"), as they are only required in small quantities.

### Monorail Train Technology

  * Complete [Tier 6](/wiki/Tier_6 "Tier 6") \- Monorail Train Technology.
  * [Trains](/wiki/Train "Train") are effective for transporting large amounts of items over long distances.
  * In this section, we will first learn to exploit this property: Trains can clip through terrain and can carry [pioneers](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer"). This allows us to clip through the mountain wall, cutting a straight-line path to the [Quartz](/wiki/Quartz "Quartz") nodes in the [cave](/wiki/Cave "Cave"). Our goal is to reduce the travel distance and belt length to a minimum. We will then bring the Raw Quartz back to the base using the shortcut path. 
    * Aside from trains and [Railways](/wiki/Railway "Railway"), [belts](/wiki/Belt "Belt"), [pipes](/wiki/Pipe "Pipe"), and [Hyper Tubes](/wiki/Hyper_Tube "Hyper Tube") all can clip through the terrain.
  * From the base, scan for [Raw Quartz](/wiki/Raw_Quartz "Raw Quartz"), then move to the slope in-between the two Quartz, as shown in the image below.
  * Build [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations") in a diagonal zigzag shape as shown for the Railways to build on.
  * Build two straight segments of Railways at 90 degrees, then connect them both with another curved Railway. Make sure the curved Railway is clipped through the ground.
  * Build a [Train Station](/wiki/Train_Station "Train Station") at one end of the Railway and [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") it.
  * Build an [Electric Locomotive](/wiki/Electric_Locomotive "Electric Locomotive") on the Railway, facing West.
  * Bring some material for the construction of [Hyper Tubes](/wiki/Hyper_Tube "Hyper Tube"), [Hyper Tube Entrances](/wiki/Hyper_Tube_Entrance "Hyper Tube Entrance"), [Power Poles](/wiki/Power_Poles "Power Poles"), and [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations"). Equip a [Jetpack](/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack").
  * Save the game, then enter the Locomotive.
  * Drive the train into the slope. Once you are inside, exit the train [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). Pioneers will always depart a train from the right-hand side.
  * Be careful not to fall off the Railway. Build a [Foundation](/wiki/Foundation "Foundation") / Double [Ramp](/wiki/Ramp "Ramp") bridge connecting the slope and the cave as shown below.
  * Use the Jetpack to move around. When constructing the ramp, be careful not to exit the ground surface.
  * Build two [belts](/wiki/Belt "Belt") and a Hyper Tube with Entrances at both sides and connect [Power Lines](/wiki/Power_Line "Power Line") as shown. 
    * Split the Hyper Tube into two at the middle of the Ramp and leave some space in between; this allows us to return to the ramp in the future.
    * The other two ends are to be placed outside the ground, one at the base and the other in the [cave](/wiki/Cave "Cave").
    * We can now clip into the ground with the Hyper Tube.
  * Dismantle the Locomotive, the Railway, and the Train Station.
  * Deliver two belts of [Raw Quartz](/wiki/Raw_Quartz "Raw Quartz") from the cave back to the base.
  * Return to the cave, collect at least 2000 [Mycelia](/wiki/Mycelia "Mycelia") by using [Chainsaw](/wiki/Chainsaw "Chainsaw"), then store them in an [Industrial Storage Container](/wiki/Industrial_Storage_Container "Industrial Storage Container").
  * Collect all the [Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug") in the cave with the [Jetpack](/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack"), then overclock both Quartz [Miners](/wiki/Miner "Miner") to 480/min (or 300/min for a normal node).


  * [](/wiki/File:Clipping_tutorial.png "Build the following setup to prepare for clipping into the mountain wall. This creates a shortcut to the Quartz cave.")

Build the following setup to prepare for clipping into the mountain wall. This creates a shortcut to the [Quartz](/wiki/Quartz "Quartz") [cave](/wiki/Cave "Cave").

  * [](/wiki/File:Under_the_earth.png "Equip a Jetpack, drive the train into the ground then exit the train here.")

Equip a [Jetpack](/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack"), drive the [train](/wiki/Train "Train") into the ground then exit the train here.

  * [](/wiki/File:Clipped_ramp.png "Build a Foundation / Double Ramp connecting the base and the cave. Build belts to transport Raw Quartz. Build Hyper Tube, split it at the middle for future access into the ground.")

Build a [Foundation](/wiki/Foundation "Foundation") / Double [Ramp](/wiki/Ramp "Ramp") connecting the base and the [cave](/wiki/Cave "Cave"). Build belts to transport [Raw Quartz](/wiki/Raw_Quartz "Raw Quartz"). Build [Hyper Tube](/wiki/Hyper_Tube "Hyper Tube"), split it at the middle for future access into the ground.

  * [](/wiki/File:Quartz_belts.png "Two belts of Raw Quartz, straight from the cave.")

Two belts of [Raw Quartz](/wiki/Raw_Quartz "Raw Quartz"), straight from the [cave](/wiki/Cave "Cave").



  * Other than using the above method, building [Conveyor Lifts](/wiki/Conveyor_Lift "Conveyor Lift") to clip through the ceiling of the cave will also work.



### GasMask

  * Automate [Biomass](/wiki/Biomass "Biomass") production by using [Constructors](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor"), each crafting a different raw item into Biomass: [Leaves](/wiki/Leaves "Leaves"), [Wood](/wiki/Wood "Wood"), [Alien Carapace](/wiki/Alien_Carapace "Alien Carapace"), [Alien Organs](/wiki/Alien_Organs "Alien Organs"). 
    * Reserve some Alien Carapace and Alien Organs for MAM [Research](/wiki/Research "Research") and for crafting [Medicinal Inhaler](/wiki/Medicinal_Inhaler "Medicinal Inhaler").
  * Build an [Assembler](/wiki/Assembler "Assembler") to craft [Fabric](/wiki/Fabric "Fabric"), then store it in an [Industrial Storage Container](/wiki/Industrial_Storage_Container "Industrial Storage Container").
  * While waiting for the Fabric to pile up, automate the production of [Crystal Oscillator](/wiki/Crystal_Oscillator "Crystal Oscillator") with two [Manufacturers](/wiki/Manufacturer "Manufacturer"). 
    * Learn how to use an [online calculator](/wiki/Calculator "Calculator") to figure out its production ratio.
    * Use the 2nd Copper belt for Crystal Oscillator production.
  * Once you have obtained enough Fabric, complete [Tier 5](/wiki/Tier_5 "Tier 5") \- GasMask. 
    * If there is excess Fabric, research [Parachute](/wiki/Parachute "Parachute").
  * Automate the production of [Filters](/wiki/Filter "Filter") with a Manufacturer. 
    * Avoid using the [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal") from Steel production and Coal power. Take the Coal by splitting it from the [Sulfur](/wiki/Sulfur "Sulfur") production instead.
  * Unlock all possible [research](/wiki/Research "Research") in MAM.
  * Equip the [Gas mask](/wiki/Gas_mask "Gas mask") and bring some [Gas Filters](/wiki/Gas_Filter "Gas Filter"); use them to collect a few [Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug") in the surrounding [Poison Gas](/wiki/Poison_Gas "Poison Gas"). 
    * More Power Slugs can be found in caves or [Poison Gas](/wiki/Poison_Gas "Poison Gas") around the base. Make use of the [Object Scanner](/wiki/Object_Scanner "Object Scanner").
    * Recall which [Miners](/wiki/Miner "Miner") you have yet to [overclock](/wiki/Overclock "Overclock"), then overclock them accordingly.



### Explorer

  * At the [MAM](/wiki/MAM "MAM"), research [Explorer](/wiki/Explorer "Explorer").
  * Build an Explorer on the ground and fuel it with [Packaged Fuel](/wiki/Packaged_Fuel "Packaged Fuel") or [Solid Biofuel](/wiki/Solid_Biofuel "Solid Biofuel"). 
    * To insert [Fuels](/wiki/Fuels "Fuels"), interact [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") with the Explorer from behind. It will display 'Press [E] to Open Workbench'.
    * To drive the Explorer, interact with it from the other direction. It will display 'Press [E] to drive Explorer'.
  * Test drive the Explorer. Avoid driving it into deep water. Shallow water is fine.
  * If you get stuck, get out of the [vehicle](/wiki/Vehicle "Vehicle") and dismantle [`F`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") it.



### Hard Drive hunting

  * This section may require from a few hours to a few days to complete. Take your time.
  * At the [MAM](/wiki/MAM "MAM"), research [Radio Signal Scanning](/wiki/Quartz_Research "Quartz Research"), Object Scanner Improvements and [Hostile Organism Detection](/wiki/Alien_Organisms "Alien Organisms"). 
    * Radio Signal Scanning allows the [Object Scanner](/wiki/Object_Scanner "Object Scanner") to scan for [Crash Sites](/wiki/Crash_Site "Crash Site") within a 300-meter radius.
    * Hostile Organism Detection allows the Object Scanner to scan for nearby enemies.
  * Use the Explorer to drive to the Oil [Islands](/wiki/Islands "Islands") and bring back 20 [stacks](/wiki/Stack "Stack") of [Packaged Fuel](/wiki/Packaged_Fuel "Packaged Fuel"). Keep only three stacks of them in [Inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") and store the remaining at the base.
  * Find an [Online Map](/wiki/Map#Save_editors "Map") such as 'Satisfactory Interactive Map', and enable the layer for [Hard Drive](/wiki/Hard_Drive "Hard Drive"). 
    * Use the online map to plan your journey. There are many Hard Drives available for collection; separate the collection of those into three or four trips.
    * Observe each of the [Crash Site](/wiki/Crash_Site "Crash Site") requirements and prepare the necessary items. For example, [Rotors](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor"), [Black Powders](/wiki/Black_Powder "Black Powder"), etc. Some require [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") which can be fulfilled by using [Biomass Burners](/wiki/Biomass_Burner "Biomass Burner").
    * Some of Crash Sites require [Superposition Oscillators](/wiki/Superposition_Oscillator "Superposition Oscillator") and [Quantum Computers](/wiki/Quantum_Computer "Quantum Computer"). As they are currently not available in-game, ignore them.
    * Ignore Crash Sites involving [Tier 7](/wiki/Tier_7 "Tier 7") items such as [Turbo Motor](/wiki/Turbo_Motor "Turbo Motor") and [Radio Control Unit](/wiki/Radio_Control_Unit "Radio Control Unit"). Revisit them after you get into Tier 7.
    * Be sure to loot the [Heat Sinks](/wiki/Heat_Sink "Heat Sink") around the [Crash Sites](/wiki/Crash_Site "Crash Site"); they can be used to unlock certain Hard Drives.
  * Use the online map in conjunction with the in-game [map](/wiki/Map "Map") to orientate yourself with the Crash Sites' position. The [Object Scanner](/wiki/Object_Scanner "Object Scanner") can also be used to lead you to the Crash Sites.
  * Take note of their elevation (z = number in centimeters) in the online map. It indicates whether a Crash Site is located on high ground.
  * Before exploration, prepare the following in [inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory"): 
    * [Rifle Cartridge](/wiki/Rifle_Cartridge "Rifle Cartridge"): min. seven stacks
    * [Iron Rod](/wiki/Iron_Rod "Iron Rod"), [Iron Plate](/wiki/Iron_Plate "Iron Plate"), [Concrete](/wiki/Concrete "Concrete"), [EIB](/wiki/EIB "EIB"), [Packaged Fuel](/wiki/Packaged_Fuel "Packaged Fuel"): three [stacks](/wiki/Stack "Stack") each.
    * [Wire](/wiki/Wire "Wire"), [Cable](/wiki/Cable "Cable"), [Quickwire](/wiki/Quickwire "Quickwire"), [Solid Biofuel](/wiki/Solid_Biofuel "Solid Biofuel"), [RIP](/wiki/RIP "RIP"), [Rotor](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor"), [Stator](/wiki/Stator "Stator"), [Motor](/wiki/Motor "Motor"), [Modular Frame](/wiki/Modular_Frame "Modular Frame"), [Steel Beam](/wiki/Steel_Beam "Steel Beam"), [Steel Pipe](/wiki/Steel_Pipe "Steel Pipe"), [Nobelisk](/wiki/Nobelisk "Nobelisk"), [Gas Filter](/wiki/Gas_Filter "Gas Filter"), [HMF](/wiki/HMF "HMF"), [Circuit Board](/wiki/Circuit_Board "Circuit Board"), [Computer](/wiki/Computer "Computer"), [A.I. Limiter](/wiki/A.I._Limiter "A.I. Limiter"), [HSC](/wiki/HSC "HSC"), [Supercomputer](/wiki/Supercomputer "Supercomputer"), [Black Powder](/wiki/Black_Powder "Black Powder"), [Quartz Crystal](/wiki/Quartz_Crystal "Quartz Crystal"), [Crystal Oscillator](/wiki/Crystal_Oscillator "Crystal Oscillator"), [Rubber](/wiki/Rubber "Rubber") \- min. one stack each
    * [Xeno-Basher](/wiki/Xeno-Basher "Xeno-Basher"), [Beryl Nut](/wiki/Beryl_Nut "Beryl Nut"), [Paleberry](/wiki/Paleberry "Paleberry"), [Chainsaw](/wiki/Chainsaw "Chainsaw"), [Nobelisk Detonator](/wiki/Nobelisk_Detonator "Nobelisk Detonator"), [Object Scanner](/wiki/Object_Scanner "Object Scanner"), [Rifle](/wiki/Rifle "Rifle"), [Blade Runners](/wiki/Blade_Runners "Blade Runners"), [Jetpack](/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack"), [Gas Mask](/wiki/Gas_Mask "Gas Mask").


  * [](/wiki/File:Inventory_for_Hard_Drive_hunting.png "Bring these with you when going to Crash Sites for collecting Hard Drives. We have automated most of these items.")

Bring these with you when going to [Crash Sites](/wiki/Crash_Site "Crash Site") for collecting [Hard Drives](/wiki/Hard_Drive "Hard Drive"). We have automated most of these items.



  * In the options, change the auto-save interval to three minutes. There is a high chance to die during the Hard Drive hunting.
  * As you retrieve a Hard Drive, build a [MAM](/wiki/MAM "MAM") immediately and then [research](/wiki/Research "Research") it. Once you click 'research', dismantle the MAM and move on to the next Hard Drive.
  * Once the 10-minute countdown timer ends, rebuild the MAM and pick one of the options given: 
    * Prioritize the following whenever possible: Inventory expansions, [Compacted Coal](/wiki/Compacted_Coal "Compacted Coal"), [Turbofuel](/wiki/Turbofuel "Turbofuel") (not Turbo Heavy Fuel), [Heavy Oil Residue](/wiki/Heavy_Oil_Residue "Heavy Oil Residue"), Diluted [Packaged Fuel](/wiki/Packaged_Fuel "Packaged Fuel"), Recycled [Plastic](/wiki/Plastic "Plastic"), Recycled [Rubber](/wiki/Rubber "Rubber").
    * If none of the above is available, then just pick any. Eventually, we will unlock all of the alternate recipes, so the order of unlocking recipes is not really important.
    * _Further reading:[Hard Drive#Alternate recipe analysis](/wiki/Hard_Drive#Alternate_recipe_analysis "Hard Drive")_
  * Collect [Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug") as you move. Craft them all into [Power Shards](/wiki/Power_Shard "Power Shard") to save on inventory space. 
    * Aim to get at least 100 [Power Shards](/wiki/Power_Shard "Power Shard") each trip.
  * Delete unnecessary items regularly such as [Leaves](/wiki/Leaves "Leaves"), [Wood](/wiki/Wood "Wood"), ores, etc. to save inventory space.
  * If [Radiation](/wiki/Radiation "Radiation") damage is received, immediately back off and avoid the area. We will need [Tier 7](/wiki/Tier_7 "Tier 7") equipment - [Hazmat Suit](/wiki/Hazmat_Suit "Hazmat Suit") to protect ourselves from Radiation.
  * Whether to equip Blade Runners, Jetpack, or Gas Mask depends on the situation as you can only choose one of them.
  * When you spot a [Lizard Doggo](/wiki/Lizard_Doggo "Lizard Doggo"), mark the location with a [Beacon](/wiki/Beacon "Beacon") and come back later to tame it. Avoid taming Lizard Doggos and hunting Hard Drives at the same time.
  * If you run out of ammo or Packaged Fuel, return to the base for restocking, then plan for the next trip.
  * Repeat until all possible Hard Drives are collected (min. 72 required).
  * By the time you have completed the Hard Drive hunting, you should have unlocked about 20 to 40 [Alternate Recipes](/wiki/Alternate_Recipes "Alternate Recipes"). (There is a total of 70 Alternate Recipes).
  * Two of the Hard Drives' results will not unlock Alternate Recipes; they will be used to expand the Inventory size instead.



### Concrete 2

  * After the [Hard Drive](/wiki/Hard_Drive "Hard Drive") hunting, we can now resume the base building operation.
  * Organize the [inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory"); keep only what is needed and store the excess in the [Personal Storage Box](/wiki/Personal_Storage_Box "Personal Storage Box"). 
    * Build additional Storage Boxes near the HUB for convenience.
  * Keep track of the 10-minute timer; research the next Hard Drive once the previous is concluded. Repeat until you unlock all the [Alternate Recipes](/wiki/Alternate_Recipes "Alternate Recipes").
  * Overclock both [Limestone](/wiki/Limestone "Limestone") [Miners](/wiki/Miner "Miner") nearby the base to 480 / min (or 300 / min for normal node) and scale up the [Concrete](/wiki/Concrete "Concrete") production.
  * It is advised to use the original Concrete recipe (Limestone -> Concrete) instead of Wet Concrete, as the Limestone nodes are abundant.


  * [](/wiki/File:Concrete_production.png "Ramping up the Concrete production for Tier 7 use. The left belt is 300 Limestone / min, the middle top belt is 480 Limestone / min.")

Ramping up the [Concrete](/wiki/Concrete "Concrete") production for [Tier 7](/wiki/Tier_7 "Tier 7") use. The left belt is 300 [Limestone](/wiki/Limestone "Limestone") / min, the middle top belt is 480 Limestone / min.




### Fuel Power

  * Chances are all four of these [Alternate Recipes](/wiki/Alternate_Recipes "Alternate Recipes") have yet to be unlocked: [Compacted Coal](/wiki/Compacted_Coal "Compacted Coal"), [Turbofuel](/wiki/Turbofuel "Turbofuel"), [Heavy Oil Residue](/wiki/Heavy_Oil_Residue "Heavy Oil Residue"), Diluted [Packaged Fuel](/wiki/Packaged_Fuel "Packaged Fuel"). Be sure to choose them when available. 
    * A list of unlocked Alternate Recipes can be viewed in [Codex](/wiki/Codex "Codex") [`X`](/wiki/Controls "Controls").
  * While waiting for the [Hard Drive](/wiki/Hard_Drive "Hard Drive") [research](/wiki/Research "Research"), build temporary [Fuel](/wiki/Fuel "Fuel") Power to prepare for Turbofuel Power.
  * For fast travelling, build a [Hyper Tube Cannon](/wiki/Hyper_Tube_Cannon "Hyper Tube Cannon") at the base, aimed at the Oil [Islands](/wiki/Islands "Islands"). Chain 15 [Hyper Tube Entrances](/wiki/Hyper_Tube_Entrance "Hyper Tube Entrance") together. 
    * _Read[Hyper Tube Cannon](/wiki/Hyper_Tube_Cannon "Hyper Tube Cannon") to learn how to construct it._
  * If there is a rock or [boulder](/wiki/Boulder "Boulder") blocking the construction, we can use a [Nobelisk Detonator](/wiki/Nobelisk_Detonator "Nobelisk Detonator") to remove it.
  * Build another Hyper Tube Cannon at the Oil Islands, aimed at the base, for efficient 2-way Hyper Tube transport. As each Entrance consumes a flat 10 MW, this setup consumes 300 MW.


  * [](/wiki/File:Nobelisk_Detonator_rock_removal.png "If a rock is in the way, detonate it with a Nobelisk Detonator.")

If a rock is in the way, detonate it with a [Nobelisk Detonator](/wiki/Nobelisk_Detonator "Nobelisk Detonator").

  * [](/wiki/File:Hyper_Tube_Cannon_at_sea.png "A Hyper Tube Cannon built at the Oil Islands, aimed at the base. Use the compass / Space Elevator to identify the direction of the base.")

A [Hyper Tube Cannon](/wiki/Hyper_Tube_Cannon "Hyper Tube Cannon") built at the Oil [Islands](/wiki/Islands "Islands"), aimed at the base. Use the [compass](/wiki/Compass "Compass") / [Space Elevator](/wiki/Space_Elevator "Space Elevator") to identify the direction of the base.

  * [](/wiki/File:Hyper_Tube_Cannon_mid_flight.png "Flying from the Rocky Desert to the Oil Islands across 1.6 km in 16 seconds \(360 km/h\).")

Flying from the [Rocky Desert](/wiki/Rocky_Desert "Rocky Desert") to the Oil [Islands](/wiki/Islands "Islands") across 1.6 km in 16 seconds (360 km/h).



  * Build 13 [Fuel Generators](/wiki/Fuel_Generator "Fuel Generator"), tapped from the [Fuel](/wiki/Fuel "Fuel") production [Refineries](/wiki/Refineries "Refineries"). Divert the [Pipes](/wiki/Pipe "Pipe") and [Junctions](/wiki/Junction "Junction") such that all the [Fuel](/wiki/Fuel "Fuel") from the Refineries are supplied to the Fuel Generators first.
  * At the end of the Fuel Generator line, stack five [Stackable Pipeline Supports](/wiki/Stackable_Pipeline_Support "Stackable Pipeline Support") and connect the Pipe through the topmost support. This introduces a head lift of 10 meters.
  * Connect the other end back to the [Packaged Fuel](/wiki/Packaged_Fuel "Packaged Fuel") Refineries.
  * This creates a Pipeline 'overflow' effect based on the combination of the following principles: 
    * [Pipes](/wiki/Pipe "Pipe") nearer to the [fluid](/wiki/Fluid "Fluid") source (such as [Extractors](/wiki/Extractor "Extractor"), Refineries) have a higher priority to be filled up first, so as the connected [buildings](/wiki/Building "Building").
    * Pipes at lower elevation will be filled up first. Higher Pipes will be filled up last.
    * Pipes partly, or entirely beyond the head lift can never be fully filled up.
  * [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") capacity increases as the Fuel Generators are added to the [Power Grid](/wiki/Power_Grid "Power Grid"). However, it is not consistent, since our fuel production is not consistent - it is tied to the production of [Plastic](/wiki/Plastic "Plastic") and [Rubber](/wiki/Rubber "Rubber").
  * We can solve this by [sinking](/wiki/Sink "Sink") all the excess [Plastic](/wiki/Plastic "Plastic") and [Rubber](/wiki/Rubber "Rubber") such that it will not clog the production of Fuel.
  * Insert a [Smart Splitter](/wiki/Smart_Splitter "Smart Splitter") onto each Plastic and Rubber [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt"), then set the side output to 'Overflow'. The same applies to the Plastic belt before the [Empty Canister](/wiki/Empty_Canister "Empty Canister") Refineries. 
    * _Further reading:[Smart Splitter](/wiki/Smart_Splitter "Smart Splitter")_
  * Connect all the overflow belts to an [AWESOME Sink](/wiki/AWESOME_Sink "AWESOME Sink").
  * Replace the earlier overflow setup for [Packaged Fuel](/wiki/Packaged_Fuel "Packaged Fuel") with a Smart Splitter too.
  * After a while, check the Fuel Pipe between the Refinery and the Fuel Generators; its flow rate should be maintained around 200 m3/min.
  * The [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") capacity is now stabilized.

    * [Sink](/wiki/Sink "Sink") all the excess material for [Coupons](/wiki/Coupon "Coupon").



### Turbofuel Power

  * [Turbofuel](/wiki/Turbofuel "Turbofuel") Power is an upgrade from the [Fuel](/wiki/Fuel "Fuel") Power. It requires four components: [Water](/wiki/Water "Water"), [Crude Oil](/wiki/Crude_Oil "Crude Oil"), [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal"), and [Sulfur](/wiki/Sulfur "Sulfur").
  * Use an [Online Map](/wiki/Online_tools#Save_editor "Online tools") and search for a location with all of these located nearby: such as the [Lake Forest](/wiki/Lake_Forest "Lake Forest") as shown below.
  * Use an Online [Calculator](/wiki/Calculator "Calculator") and select a combination of the most efficient [Alternate Recipes](/wiki/Alternate_Recipes "Alternate Recipes") for crafting Turbofuel. Its production will be bottlenecked by the amount of Sulfur, as there are only two normal Sulfur nodes around for 600 Sulfur/min. This in turn limits the [Turbofuel](/wiki/Turbofuel "Turbofuel") production to 750 m3/min.
  * The maximum amount of [fluid](/wiki/Fluid "Fluid") involved is in between 600 m3/min and 900 m3/min. By separating the setup into three smaller, repeatable modules, the fluid flow within each module will be under 300 m3/min.
  * Turbofuel burns at a rate of 4.5 m3/min for each [Fuel Generator](/wiki/Fuel_Generator "Fuel Generator"). `750 / 4.5 = 166.67`; round it up to the nearest multiple of 3, which is 168. We will then build 168 Fuel Generators.
  * We need 42 [Refineries](/wiki/Refineries "Refineries") for Turbofuel - as we round up to the nearest multiple of 3.
  * Build a floating platform (57 x 48). You may use other designs according to your own creativity/preference.
  * Build Hyper Tube Cannons for fast transport between the base and the Turbofuel Power outpost. We will need to travel frequently between these two areas.
  * Tap all of the three nearby [Oil](/wiki/Oil "Oil") nodes and [overclock](/wiki/Overclock "Overclock") each of them to 300 m3/min. We only use two of them as the [Crude Oil](/wiki/Crude_Oil "Crude Oil") required is only 337.5 / min.
  * Tap all of the nearby [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal") and [Sulfur](/wiki/Sulfur "Sulfur") nodes and overclock each to 480/min (or 300/min for normal node).
  * Build floating [Foundation](/wiki/Foundation "Foundation") bridges or [Ramps](/wiki/Ramps "Ramps") to access and transport the required resources.
  * There will be three identical modules to be built. Focus on one module at a time. After a module is built and is up and running, repeat the design another two times to complete the full setup. 
    * A module consists of: three [Water Extractors](/wiki/Water_Extractor "Water Extractor"), eight [Assemblers](/wiki/Assembler "Assembler"), 33 [Refineries](/wiki/Refineries "Refineries"), and 56 [Fuel Generators](/wiki/Fuel_Generator "Fuel Generator"). The platform size for a module is 57 x 16.
    * The [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt") and [Crude Oil](/wiki/Crude_Oil "Crude Oil") inputs will be shared among modules.
  * As the platform is located at a high elevation that exceeds the 10-meter head lift of an [Oil Extractor](/wiki/Oil_Extractor "Oil Extractor"), a series of [Pipeline Pumps](/wiki/Pipeline_Pump "Pipeline Pump") are required to pump up the Crude Oil.
  * Temporarily open a hole in the platform by removing a [Foundation](/wiki/Foundation "Foundation") nearby a [Junction](/wiki/Junction "Junction"), then build a stack of [Walls](/wiki/Walls "Walls") downwards for the Pipeline Pump to be snapped on. Build one piece of the wall above the platform, then build the walls all the way down to the ground level where the [Oil Extractors](/wiki/Oil_Extractor "Oil Extractor") are located.
  * Delete the topmost wall that is above the platform.
  * Use a [Color Gun](/wiki/Color_Gun "Color Gun") loaded with some [Color Cartridges](/wiki/Color_Cartridge "Color Cartridge"), paint it [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") with any color other than the first color theme. [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right") to switch the color theme. In this example, the red color is chosen. 
    * The Color Gun is unlocked at [MAM](/wiki/MAM "MAM"). _Further reading:[Color Gun](/wiki/Color_Gun "Color Gun")_
  * From the ground and counting up, paint the 2nd wall. Then skip four walls and paint the 5th (the 7th wall from the ground). Repeat all the way up. If the highest wall is colored, paint the 2nd highest instead.
  * On the side of each colored wall, build a Pipeline Pump and make sure its arrow is pointed up. Place it in the same relative position of the wall for each colored wall. 
    * Build a tall structure such as a Radar Tower or use a [Jetpack](/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack") to climb to a higher elevation. It is easier to build these Pipeline Pumps while standing on a higher elevation.
  * Connect the [Pipelines](/wiki/Pipelines "Pipelines") and [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") the Pumps using [Wall Outlet Mk.2](/wiki/Wall_Outlet_Mk.2 "Wall Outlet Mk.2"), which is unlockable at the [AWESOME Shop](/wiki/AWESOME_Shop "AWESOME Shop"). 
    * To cover the hole in the platform, rebuild the Foundation and then join the last segment of the Pipeline between the topmost Pump and the Junction. Make sure the [Pipeline Pump](/wiki/Pipeline_Pump "Pipeline Pump") is not blocking the Foundation.
    * You may need to temporarily remove some adjacent Foundations during this process.
  * Check if the upper Pipes are receiving [Crude Oil](/wiki/Crude_Oil "Crude Oil"). If not, check the placement of the Pumps, the connectivity of the Pipe, and whether all the Pumps are Powered.
  * Merge the [Water](/wiki/Water "Water") output from three [Water Extractors](/wiki/Water_Extractor "Water Extractor") into one [Pipe](/wiki/Pipe "Pipe"), then bring the Water up using the same method. 
    * Do not worry too much about the Water Extractors' placement; there is plenty of space in the [lake](/wiki/Lake_Forest "Lake Forest") and we only need to build 11 of them.
    * Optional: For the aesthetic and color-coding purpose, paint the Crude Oil pipes in black and the Water pipes in blue. Have fun with the colors!
  * Prime the setup by manually putting 15 stacks of [Empty Canisters](/wiki/Empty_Canister "Empty Canister") into five [Packaged Water](/wiki/Packaged_Water "Packaged Water") Refineries. As `15 / 5 = 3`, we need to separate this action into three occurrences. 
    * Use the [Hyper Tube Cannon](/wiki/Hyper_Tube_Cannon "Hyper Tube Cannon"). Instead of flying back to the base, use the directional keys to divert the flight path to the Oil [Islands](/wiki/Islands "Islands"). Take the Canisters and fly back to the Turbofuel outpost using the same method.
  * The Empty Canisters involved in the setup are fully reusable; this means neither input nor overflow is required. Form a closed loop with [Splitters](/wiki/Splitter "Splitter"), [Mergers](/wiki/Merger "Merger"), and a [Storage Container](/wiki/Storage_Container "Storage Container") as the buffer. 
    * The buffer can be located either at the Empty Canister belt or the [Packaged Water](/wiki/Packaged_Water "Packaged Water") belt–both work.
  * The [Heavy Oil Residue](/wiki/Heavy_Oil_Residue "Heavy Oil Residue") [Refineries](/wiki/Refineries "Refineries") will produce [Polymer Resin](/wiki/Polymer_Resin "Polymer Resin") as a byproduct. Refine it into [Polyester Fabric](/wiki/Fabric "Fabric") and store it in a Container. [Sink](/wiki/Sink "Sink") the overflow Resin.

The completed [Turbofuel](/wiki/Turbofuel "Turbofuel") Power outpost, generating 25 GW. This Map is generated by uploading the [save files](/wiki/Save_files "Save files") to Satisfactory Interactive Map[5].



  * The entire setup should add 25000 MW (or 25 GW) to the [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") capacity. 
    * Allow some time for Power capacity to be stabilized; it takes time for [Turbofuel](/wiki/Turbofuel "Turbofuel") to fill up the [Pipe](/wiki/Pipe "Pipe") network.
    * `750 / 4.5 x 150 = 25000 MW`, where 750 is Turbofuel produced per min, 4.5 is the consumption rate, and 150 is the Power capacity of each [Fuel Generator](/wiki/Fuel_Generator "Fuel Generator").
  * Optional: disconnect the [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal") belts supplying the Coal Power to free up the four Coal nodes.
  * Dismantle the [Fabric](/wiki/Fabric "Fabric") [Assembler](/wiki/Assembler "Assembler") at the base, which is using [Biomass](/wiki/Biomass "Biomass") and [Mycelia](/wiki/Mycelia "Mycelia"). We are now producing the Fabric with [Polymer Resin](/wiki/Polymer_Resin "Polymer Resin") instead. 
    * As Fabric is consumed only in small amounts, you may choose to belt it to the base from the Turbofuel outpost or by manually carrying it back once in a while.



### Bauxite Refinement

  * Complete [Tier 7](/wiki/Tier_7 "Tier 7") \- Bauxite Refinement.
  * There are new Alternate Recipes that can be unlocked via [Hard Drives](/wiki/Hard_Drive "Hard Drive"). Pick Electrode [Aluminum Scrap](/wiki/Aluminum_Scrap "Aluminum Scrap") when completing its research. 
    * Scan the Hard Drive again for Pure [Aluminum Ingot](/wiki/Aluminum_Ingot "Aluminum Ingot"); however, that recipe will not be used in this guide.
  * Scan for [Bauxite](/wiki/Bauxite "Bauxite"). The nearest three patches are all located on the rocky cliffs near the [Red Jungle](/wiki/Red_Jungle "Red Jungle").
  * [Bauxite](/wiki/Bauxite "Bauxite"), [Water](/wiki/Water "Water"), [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal"), [Raw Quartz](/wiki/Raw_Quartz "Raw Quartz"), [Copper Ore](/wiki/Copper_Ore "Copper Ore"), and [Limestone](/wiki/Limestone "Limestone") are required to produce [Alclad Aluminum Sheet](/wiki/Alclad_Aluminum_Sheet "Alclad Aluminum Sheet") efficiently. 
    * You may skip [Raw Quartz](/wiki/Raw_Quartz "Raw Quartz") and [Limestone](/wiki/Limestone "Limestone") by sacrificing some of the resource efficiency, exchanging [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal") with [Petroleum Coke](/wiki/Petroleum_Coke "Petroleum Coke").
  * Use the online map to search for a suitable location for setting up the Aluminum production. As water is difficult to transport, build the production area near a large water body, preferably on the sea.
  * Use [Trains](/wiki/Train "Train") for long-range transport (> 800m) from now on. 
    * Trains are effective for distances of more than 800 meters. For shorter distances, it is advised to use [belts](/wiki/Belt "Belt") instead, as Trains take time to accelerate and brake and thus have their throughput reduced at shorter distances.
  * Use an Online Map and plan the logistical layout: 
    * Pick which [Resource Nodes](/wiki/Resource_Node "Resource Node") you are going to use and claim all the necessary nodes by [removing the hostile creatures](/wiki/Combat "Combat") and placing a [Powered](/wiki/Power "Power") [Miner](/wiki/Miner "Miner") on them.
    * Plan the location of [Train Stations](/wiki/Train_Station "Train Station") and the belt layout between the Miners and the [Freight Platforms](/wiki/Freight_Platform "Freight Platform").
    * Build [Foundation](/wiki/Foundation "Foundation") or [Ramp](/wiki/Ramp "Ramp") bridges for the [Railway](/wiki/Railway "Railway"). Avoid using [Double Ramp 8m x 8m](/wiki/Double_Ramp_8m_x_8m "Double Ramp 8m x 8m") or [Ramp 8m x 4m](/wiki/Ramp_8m_x_4m "Ramp 8m x 4m") as they are too steep for the Railways and Trains.
    * A Railway has a minimum turning radius of 17 meters.
    * Laying Railways on the natural terrain can be challenging.
  * Plan where to build the [Water Extractors](/wiki/Water_Extractor "Water Extractor") and how to [Pipe](/wiki/Pipe "Pipe") them to the production area. Minimize the head lift and distance when dealing with [fluid](/wiki/Fluid "Fluid") transport.
  * Always build a [Hyper Tube Cannon](/wiki/Hyper_Tube_Cannon "Hyper Tube Cannon") for every outpost.


  * [](/wiki/File:Online_map_Aluminum_production_area.png "Build the Aluminum production outpost on the sea for easy access to Water.")

Build the [Aluminum](/wiki/Aluminum "Aluminum") production outpost on the sea for easy access to [Water](/wiki/Water "Water").



  * Railways conduct [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") between [Train Stations](/wiki/Train_Station "Train Station")–make use of it when expanding the [Power Grid](/wiki/Power_Grid "Power Grid"). 
    * Build the first Station near the [sea](/wiki/Sea "Sea") and [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") it. Build the 2nd Station near the center of the three [Bauxite](/wiki/Bauxite "Bauxite") nodes. This station receives Power from the first via the [Railway](/wiki/Railway "Railway"). Build the 3rd Station near the 2nd, as a transfer Station for the [Quartz](/wiki/Quartz "Quartz"). Connect the Power to the 3rd station from the 2nd via [Power Poles](/wiki/Power_Poles "Power Poles"). Build the 4th Station near the Quartz nodes, then transfer the Power to the Quartz Miner via the 4th station. Refer to the image below.
  * Both [Quartz](/wiki/Quartz "Quartz") nodes are located in the cave on the lower ground.
  * The rocky area in the [Red Jungle](/wiki/Red_Jungle "Red Jungle") is contaminated with [Radiation](/wiki/Radiation "Radiation"). Bring plenty of [Nuts](/wiki/Nut "Nut") for healing and be cautious against surrounding creatures.
  * There are plenty of [Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug") around–be sure to pick them up.
  * You might encounter some invisible plants around the [Red Jungle](/wiki/Red_Jungle "Red Jungle") which are blocking construction. Cut them down with [Chainsaw](/wiki/Chainsaw "Chainsaw") or with a [Nobelisk Detonator](/wiki/Nobelisk_Detonator "Nobelisk Detonator").
  * For the ratio of [Electric Locomotive](/wiki/Electric_Locomotive "Electric Locomotive") and [Freight Car](/wiki/Freight_Car "Freight Car") vs the resources transported, take note of the [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt") throughput and resource item [stack](/wiki/Stack "Stack") size. We need the Train's round trip time to be less than the maximum allowed period. 
    * [Read here for more information](/wiki/Tutorial:Train_Throughput?action=edit&redlink=1 "Tutorial:Train Throughput \(page does not exist\)").
    * From the table, pick 'a Mk.5 [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt") for each [Freight Car](/wiki/Freight_Car "Freight Car")', and ores have a [stack](/wiki/Stack "Stack") size of 100. Thus we need to aim for a round trip time of less than four minutes and six seconds, including loading/unloading time.
  * Give each Station a name as an identifier.
  * At each unloading [Freight Platform](/wiki/Freight_Platform "Freight Platform"), set them to 'unload' the cargo. Freight Platforms are set to load by default.
  * Interact [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") with a [Train Station](/wiki/Train_Station "Train Station") or the [Electric Locomotive](/wiki/Electric_Locomotive "Electric Locomotive") [`V`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), give the Train a name, and set the timetable as per the below image, then set it to 'Auto' mode.
  * Test the train by parking the train before the loading Station, then inserting a random item into the Freight Platform and let the train run automatically. Use a stopwatch to measure its round trip time. 
    * You may wait at the Station or ride the Locomotive. Do not stand on a [Freight Car](/wiki/Freight_Car "Freight Car") as it is dangerous.
  * If the time taken is within 00:04:06, consider removing some of the Locomotives to save [Power](/wiki/Power "Power"), provided there is at least one remaining Locomotive pulling the train. If the time is longer than 00:04:06, attach more Locomotives to increase the pulling force. 
    * If it is still not achievable within the time period, consider increasing the setup to two Freight Cars per resource [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt") and the number of Locomotives. The Train Station needs to be modified to accommodate the increased Train length.
  * Beside each Freight Platform, build an [Industrial Storage Container](/wiki/Industrial_Storage_Container "Industrial Storage Container") and connect them with two belts, depending on whether it is set to load or unload. Between the Container and the factory / Miners, connect with only one belt. The Industrial Storage Container is necessary because belts connecting to the Freight Platform are paused for 25 seconds during loading and unloading of a [Freight Car](/wiki/Freight_Car "Freight Car").
  * Due to the Train bug, sometimes the build menu will be disabled after exiting a train. To re-enable the build menu, try entering and exiting a [Hyper Tube](/wiki/Hyper_Tube "Hyper Tube") or by saving-loading the game.

  * Have all the resources ready at the [Aluminum](/wiki/Aluminum "Aluminum") production area, then proceed to the next section. 
    * [Bauxite](/wiki/Bauxite "Bauxite"): Three belts (two pure + one normal), [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal"): two belts (one pure + one normal), [Quartz](/wiki/Quartz "Quartz"): two belts (pure), [Copper Ore](/wiki/Copper_Ore "Copper Ore"): one belt (normal).



### Advanced Aluminum Production

  * Setup the [Aluminum](/wiki/Aluminum "Aluminum") production as shown below.
  * Two products are being reused: [Water](/wiki/Water "Water") and [Silica](/wiki/Silica "Silica"). 
    * The [Water](/wiki/Water "Water") gets partially recycled in the process, thus a lower amount of 'fresh' Water from [Water Extractors](/wiki/Water_Extractor "Water Extractor") is required.
    * 'Fresh' refers to the Water that is not produced as a byproduct. 'Recycled' and 'Fresh' Water are both the same resources.
    * [Silica](/wiki/Silica "Silica") is produced as a by-product which is then re-used in the next refining step, thus we require less 'fresh' Silica from the [Raw Quartz](/wiki/Raw_Quartz "Raw Quartz").
    * Backlogged by-products can clog [Refineries](/wiki/Refineries "Refineries") and stop their production.
  * To handle Water: 
    * 96 m3/min of recycled Water is sufficient for 0.96 * Refinery producing [Alumina Solution](/wiki/Alumina_Solution "Alumina Solution"). [Pipe](/wiki/Pipe "Pipe") the water to a single, dedicated Refinery, [underclocked](/wiki/Underclock "Underclock") to 96 %. This Refinery should not be connected to the 'fresh' Water pipes (that is, from [Water Extractors](/wiki/Water_Extractor "Water Extractor")).
    * The clock speed of the remaining three Refineries should add up to 264%. [Underclock](/wiki/Underclock "Underclock") one of them to 64%. Otherwise, they may consume too much [Bauxite](/wiki/Bauxite "Bauxite") and cause the first Refinery handling the recycled Water to starve. (`360 - 96 = 264`)
    * Optional: underclock the Water Extractors and Refineries crafting Electrode [Aluminum Scraps](/wiki/Aluminum_Scrap "Aluminum Scrap"). They will still work even if not underclocked.
  * To handle [Silica](/wiki/Silica "Silica"): 
    * A simple but inefficient way is to [Sink](/wiki/Sink "Sink") the Silica by-products.
    * Avoid wastage by merging the recycled Silica with the fresh Silica [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt") after the Silica [Constructors](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor") but before the [Foundries](/wiki/Foundries "Foundries").
    * [Mergers](/wiki/Merger "Merger") always attempt to merge input belts equally regardless if the belts are saturated. The recycled Silica, being the lesser amount compared to the fresh, tends to be used up first, so there is no chance of clogging.
    * If you merge the recycled Silica belt before the Silica Constructors, it will clog.
  * Refer to the image below for byproduct handling. Observe the belts' and pipes' routing.
  * Test the setup by [sinking](/wiki/Sink "Sink") all the [Alclad Aluminum Sheets](/wiki/Alclad_Aluminum_Sheet "Alclad Aluminum Sheet") and check if any machine is not running properly. You can remove the [AWESOME Sink](/wiki/AWESOME_Sink "AWESOME Sink") once you are satisfied with the setup.
  * Transport the Alclad Aluminum Sheet back to base via a [Train](/wiki/Train "Train"). 
    * Optional: Lay the [Railway](/wiki/Railway "Railway") on the natural terrain.
  * Complete [Tier 7](/wiki/Tier_7 "Tier 7") \- Advanced Aluminum Production.

### Radio Control Unit

  * Radio Control Unit is one of the ingredients in [Turbo Motor](/wiki/Turbo_Motor "Turbo Motor").
  * Research [Radio Control Unit](/wiki/Radio_Control_Unit "Radio Control Unit") at the [MAM](/wiki/MAM "MAM").
  * Research [Hard Drives](/wiki/Hard_Drive "Hard Drive") for Alternate Recipes: [Radio Control System](/wiki/Radio_Control_Unit "Radio Control Unit"), [Heat Exchanger](/wiki/Heat_Sink "Heat Sink"), and [Turbo Rigour Motor](/wiki/Turbo_Motor "Turbo Motor").
  * Setup the Radio Control Unit a.k.a [RCU](/wiki/RCU "RCU") production as below. 
    * Do not be afraid to build [spaghetti](/wiki/Belt "Belt"). These are all temporary.
    * Whenever we 'tap' an existing ingredient resource without a dedicated production line, make sure not to exceed its current production rate.
    * For example, tapping [Supercomputers](/wiki/Supercomputer "Supercomputer") from their [Container](/wiki/Container "Container") for RCU production. As the Supercomputer production rate is 0.5 / min, we must not exceed it or else the Supercomputers in the Container will be exhausted.
    * Make sure the RCU [Manufacturer](/wiki/Manufacturer "Manufacturer") is [underclocked](/wiki/Underclock "Underclock") appropriately; refer to the diagram below.
  * Update the hotkey and use [Conveyor Belt Mk.5](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt_Mk.5 "Conveyor Belt Mk.5") and [Conveyor Lift Mk.5](/wiki/Conveyor_Lift_Mk.5 "Conveyor Lift Mk.5") from now on.

### Hazmat Suit

  * Complete [Tier 7](/wiki/Tier_7 "Tier 7") \- Hazmat Suit.
  * Automate the production of [Iodine Infused Filters](/wiki/Iodine_Infused_Filter "Iodine Infused Filter") with a [Manufacturer](/wiki/Manufacturer "Manufacturer"). 
    * Make sure the upstream [Gas Filter](/wiki/Gas_Filter "Gas Filter") production is running.
  * Craft a [Hazmat Suit](/wiki/Hazmat_Suit "Hazmat Suit"). Equip it and bring a [stack](/wiki/Stack "Stack") of [Iodine Infused Filters](/wiki/Iodine_Infused_Filter "Iodine Infused Filter"), go back to the [radioactive](/wiki/Radioactive "Radioactive") area at the [Bauxite](/wiki/Bauxite "Bauxite") loading [Station](/wiki/Train_Station "Train Station"), and mine out all the [Uranium](/wiki/Uranium "Uranium") [deposits](/wiki/Deposit "Deposit") (the green-glowing rocks). They are the source of the [radiation](/wiki/Radiation "Radiation"). 
    * Either store the mined [Uranium](/wiki/Uranium "Uranium") in a [Container](/wiki/Container "Container") or delete it. We will be able to mass-produce them later on so it doesn't matter.



### Turbo Motors - With AWESOME Shop

  * Build a bootstrap [Turbo Motor](/wiki/Turbo_Motor "Turbo Motor") production as shown below.
  * Once the factory is running, go to [AWESOME Shop](/wiki/AWESOME_Shop "AWESOME Shop") and buy [Turbo Motors](/wiki/Turbo_Motor "Turbo Motor"). 
    * We have about 50 [Miners](/wiki/Miner "Miner") so far. As each [Miner Mk.3](/wiki/Miner_Mk.3 "Miner Mk.3") requires five Turbo Motors to build, purchase at least 250 [Turbo Motors](/wiki/Turbo_Motor "Turbo Motor").
    * After the purchase is made, the bought items are stored under the 'Purchases' tab. [`Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")+[](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") to transfer them to the [pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer")'s [inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory").
    * We should have generated a plenty of [Coupons](/wiki/Coupon "Coupon") from the overflowing [Packaged Fuel](/wiki/Packaged_Fuel "Packaged Fuel"), [Plastic](/wiki/Plastic "Plastic"), [Rubber](/wiki/Rubber "Rubber"), and [Polymer Resin](/wiki/Polymer_Resin "Polymer Resin").
  * Alternatively, we can wait for the Turbo Motors to be produced in the [Manufacturer](/wiki/Manufacturer "Manufacturer").

Some [Turbo Motors](/wiki/Turbo_Motor "Turbo Motor") purchased from the [AWESOME Shop](/wiki/AWESOME_Shop "AWESOME Shop") using the [FICSIT Coupons](/wiki/FICSIT_Coupon "FICSIT Coupon").



  * Replace all the Miners Mk.2 with Mk.3. This will double up the production of every [Resource Node](/wiki/Resource_Node "Resource Node") we have tapped so far. 
    * It is advised to start the Miner upgrade from the [Aluminum](/wiki/Aluminum "Aluminum") production chain, as we have to increase the [Turbo Motor](/wiki/Turbo_Motor "Turbo Motor") production later.
  * From now on, all new Miners will be built with Miner Mk.3. 
    * Always [overclock](/wiki/Overclock "Overclock") [pure](/wiki/Purity "Purity") Miners to 163% as to match the Mk.5 [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt") speed. Beyond that is just a waste of [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") and [Power Shards](/wiki/Power_Shard "Power Shard").
    * For normal and impure Miners, they are capped at 600/min and 300/min respectively at 250% clock speed.
  * Complete [Tier 7](/wiki/Tier_7 "Tier 7") \- Nuclear Power. 
    * Research all remaining [Alternate Recipes](/wiki/Alternate_Recipe "Alternate Recipe"). There are three more to go, all related to the [Uranium](/wiki/Uranium "Uranium") Chain.



### Aluminum 2

  * As the highest tier of [Miner](/wiki/Miner "Miner") and [Conveyor Belt](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt "Conveyor Belt") are now available, we are ready to start full-scale [Aluminum](/wiki/Aluminum "Aluminum") production.
  * Upgrade all the [Miners](/wiki/Miner "Miner") and [belts](/wiki/Belt "Belt"). Color code the [Freight Platforms](/wiki/Freight_Platform "Freight Platform") to identify whether they are transporting 780/min or 600/min. (300/min for impure) 
    * Any other method of identification is fine, as long as you can distinguish between belts of different item rates.
    * In the image below, 780/min is painted green, while 600/min is painted cyan.
  * Until the new production is running, do not dismantle the existing Aluminum production.
  * Use an Online Calculator and input the numbers for desired [Alclad Aluminum Sheets](/wiki/Alclad_Aluminum_Sheet "Alclad Aluminum Sheet") per minute. Do not exceed the mining rate of [Bauxite](/wiki/Bauxite "Bauxite") which is 2160 / min. (`780 + 780 + 600 = 2160`)
  * Optional: Use Cheap [Silica](/wiki/Silica "Silica") to minimize the [Quartz](/wiki/Quartz "Quartz") consumption.
  * Optional: Use Pure [Copper Ingot](/wiki/Copper_Ingot "Copper Ingot") in a [Refinery](/wiki/Refinery "Refinery") to minimize the [Copper Ore](/wiki/Copper_Ore "Copper Ore") consumption.
  * Expand the platform. Be careful not to go too near to the edge of the [World](/wiki/World "World"), as the pioneer will start to [receive 'out of bound' damage](/wiki/World#World_size "World"). Also, some areas of the sea are not swimmable. 
    * [Water Extractors](/wiki/Water_Extractor "Water Extractor") cannot be built on some areas of the sea, especially when located far away from the shoreline. _Further reading:[Water Extractor#Water depth](/wiki/Water_Extractor#Water_depth "Water Extractor")_
  * In the schematic, observe that some of the items' flow rates have exceeded the Mk.5 belt capacity (divide the item rate by 780): 
    * [Aluminum Scrap](/wiki/Aluminum_Scrap "Aluminum Scrap"): Six belts
    * [Silica](/wiki/Silica "Silica"): Four belts
    * [Bauxite](/wiki/Bauxite "Bauxite"): Three belts
    * [Limestone](/wiki/Limestone "Limestone"), [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal"), and [Aluminum Ingot](/wiki/Aluminum_Ingot "Aluminum Ingot"): Two belts each
  * Split the setup into six smaller modules, such that each module will not contain items with rates of more than 780/min. 
    * By using the calculator, we can deduce that 120 [Alclad Aluminum Sheet](/wiki/Alclad_Aluminum_Sheet "Alclad Aluminum Sheet")/min is a nice number for a single module.
    * The modules can be tiled in a 3 x 2 array. The resources using two belts will be fed from the longer side such that each belt serves three modules, while the resources using three belts will be fed from the shorter side.
    * The last module will be smaller with the leftovers, as `685 - (5 × 120) = 85` or `685 % 120 = 85`.
    * Use the calculator and down-size the last module based on 85/min. This means some machines will have to be removed compared with the 120/min module.
  * [Copper Ore](/wiki/Copper_Ore "Copper Ore") and [Raw Quartz](/wiki/Raw_Quartz "Raw Quartz") are within one belt, so a single belt of each is sufficient to supply all six modules.
  * Below is an example layout of a module producing 120 Alclads/min.
  * From the module schematic, observe that there are some buildings with a production of less than 0.5; this means these buildings can be shared with an adjacent, mirrored module. If it is less than 0.25, it can be shared among the four modules.
  * When tiling the modules, observe all the tile-able elements and make use of mirroring/flipping to reduce the number of buildings required.
  * Once a module works, proceed to build the remaining modules.
  * To handle the 'leftover' material from a belt, use the [Overflow Splitter](/wiki/Overflow_Splitter "Overflow Splitter")–that is, [Smart Splitter](/wiki/Smart_Splitter "Smart Splitter") with the overflow settings. Use this to merge the leftovers from the 780 [Bauxite](/wiki/Bauxite "Bauxite") belts to the 600 Bauxite belt.
  * As always, check the setup and make sure everything is running properly.
  * We will not be using the full 685 [Alclad Aluminum Sheet](/wiki/Alclad_Aluminum_Sheet "Alclad Aluminum Sheet")/min at the moment, so there are two approaches: 
    * To farm [Sink](/wiki/Sink "Sink") points and to let the factory run at all times, use a [Sink](/wiki/Sink "Sink") to handle the overflow.
    * To conserve [Power](/wiki/Power "Power"), leave the factory to run on demand.
  * On some occasions the automated [Trains](/wiki/Train "Train") might stop working for no reason. From time to time, use the [Map](/wiki/Map "Map") to check if all trains are working properly. 
    * To get an automated Train unstuck, enter the Train [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), disable its auto mode, manually drive the train backward [`W`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") for a short distance, then re-enable the Train's auto mode.

### Nuclear Fuel Rod

  * We will have a few mega projects in the following sections, hence the 25 GW of [Turbofuel](/wiki/Turbofuel "Turbofuel") Power may be insufficient.
  * Nuclear Power produces large amounts of [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") from a relatively small amount of resources; however the refining process for [Nuclear Fuel Rods](/wiki/Nuclear_Fuel_Rod "Nuclear Fuel Rod") (NFR) is complex and it consumes a lot of power.
  * The production of [Nuclear Fuel Rods](/wiki/Nuclear_Fuel_Rod "Nuclear Fuel Rod") requires nine Raw Ingredients: [Water](/wiki/Water "Water"), [Iron Ore](/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore"), [Copper Ore](/wiki/Copper_Ore "Copper Ore"), [Limestone](/wiki/Limestone "Limestone"), [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal"), [Caterium Ore](/wiki/Caterium_Ore "Caterium Ore"), [Raw Quartz](/wiki/Raw_Quartz "Raw Quartz"), [Sulfur](/wiki/Sulfur "Sulfur"), and [Uranium](/wiki/Uranium "Uranium").
  * Using the [Online Map](/wiki/Online_tools#Save_editor "Online tools"), there is a location with all these packed close together, that is, right at our old [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal") Power location. [Uranium](/wiki/Uranium "Uranium") is the only resource that is far away, but we can bring it in with a [Train](/wiki/Train "Train"). 
    * As [Nuclear Power Plants](/wiki/Nuclear_Power_Plant "Nuclear Power Plant") require lots of water to run, we will build the setup at the North [sea](/wiki/Sea "Sea") as shown below.
  * Use an Online [Calculator](/wiki/Calculator "Calculator") to calculate the schematic for 10 Nuclear Fuel Rods/min and utilize some of the [Alternate Recipes](/wiki/Alternate_Recipes "Alternate Recipes"). 
    * 10 Nuclear Fuel Rods/min is chosen such that the item rate of each raw resource is less than one belt (780/min), which simplifies the setup.
    * These Rods can be fed into 50 [Nuclear Power Plants](/wiki/Nuclear_Power_Plant "Nuclear Power Plant") which will produce 125 GW in total (125000 MW).
    * This setup can be expanded in the future, as there are plenty of resources around.
  * The only resource that is still in use by another production chain is Sulfur. Just use a [Splitter](/wiki/Splitter "Splitter") to split its belt to the Nuclear Power.
  * Observe the [NFR](/wiki/NFR "NFR") schematic is complex and difficult to read. We can simplify it by splitting its schematic so that each part only calculates a few ingredients. Customize the calculator and enable or disable certain recipes.
  * The tricky part is the handling of recycled [Sulfuric Acid](/wiki/Sulfuric_Acid "Sulfuric Acid"). We will use the same technique for [Water](/wiki/Water "Water")-recycling that we learned in Aluminum production.
  * Wear a [Hazmat Suit](/wiki/Hazmat_Suit "Hazmat Suit") and bring along [Iodine Infused Filters](/wiki/Iodine_Infused_Filter "Iodine Infused Filter") when handling [radioactive](/wiki/Radioactive "Radioactive") products. However, when wearing it, you cannot run or fly, so it is advised to only connect the [Uranium](/wiki/Uranium "Uranium") [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt") during the final steps.
  * When everything is built and [Powered](/wiki/Power "Power"), let the factory run first without the Uranium input. Check if all buildings are working. 
    * By uploading the [save file](/wiki/Save_file "Save file") to an Online Map, we can check the Power, Belt, and Pipe connections easily and verify which building(s) is not properly connected.
    * As the production scale is large, allow plenty of time for the resources to be delivered to all [buildings](/wiki/Building "Building"). Buildings at the end of a [Manifold](/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") have to wait for all the preceding buildings to be filled up first before receiving their ingredients.
    * Quiz: In the plan below (the last image in this section), there is one building not connected to Power. Try to spot it.
  * All [Uranium](/wiki/Uranium "Uranium")-related buildings will show fault indicators, which is the Yellow [Indicator Light](/wiki/Indicator_Light "Indicator Light") due to lack of ingredient(s). 
    * These buildings will be [radioactive](/wiki/Radioactive "Radioactive") once they start running.
    * Build [Walkways](/wiki/Walkway "Walkway") nearby these buildings. The Walkways should be positioned above the [Belts](/wiki/Belt "Belt") / [Pipes](/wiki/Pipe "Pipe") / [Splitters](/wiki/Splitter "Splitter"), and when you stand on them, you should be able to interact with the aforementioned buildings.
    * Elevated Walkways should start and end with [Walkway Ramps](/wiki/Walkway_Ramp "Walkway Ramp").
    * This allows us to wear a Hazmat Suit, stand on the walkway, and interact with these buildings easily, without the need to jump.
    * Build Walkway bridges for crossing parallel belts or buses.
  * Do not build any [Storage Containers](/wiki/Storage_Container "Storage Container") for storing the Nuclear Fuel Rods. 
    * If you fall into the water while wearing a [Hazmat Suit](/wiki/Hazmat_Suit "Hazmat Suit"), switch to the [Jetpack](/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack") or [Blade Runners](/wiki/Blade_Runners "Blade Runners") to jump out of the water and onto a [Foundation](/wiki/Foundation "Foundation").
  * Connect the Uranium belt and unpause the Uranium Train. Let the factory run.

### Nuclear Power

  * Add 50 [Nuclear Power Plants](/wiki/Nuclear_Power_Plant "Nuclear Power Plant") and 125 [Water Extractors](/wiki/Water_Extractor "Water Extractor") to the [To Do List](/wiki/To_Do_List "To Do List").
  * Extend the platform into the open sea. For each pair of Nuclear Power Plant, use the modular layout as shown below.
  * Build five Water Extractors in a 'W' arrangement; allocate enough space for two additional [Pipes](/wiki/Pipe "Pipe") to connect the outer Extractors. 
    * The feed Pipe should be built from the Nuclear Power Plant to the [Junction](/wiki/Junction "Junction"), not the other way round. Switch the build mode [`R`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to 'Vertical' mode and build the Pipe as shown.
    * Connect the Water Extractors and the Junctions with '2D Conveyor' mode.
    * Repeat building the modules until 50 Nuclear Power Plants are built.
  * A Nuclear Power Plant produces five [Nuclear Waste](/wiki/Nuclear_Waste "Nuclear Waste")/min when running at 100 %.
  * The Nuclear Waste needs to be [belted](/wiki/Belt "Belt") away from Power Plants to prevent them from jamming. Since the Waste cannot be deleted in any way and they are [radioactive](/wiki/Radioactive "Radioactive"), it is advised to store it at the edge of the [world](/wiki/World "World"). 
    * Construct a long belt on a [Foundation](/wiki/Foundation "Foundation") bridge and bring it to the North edge of the [Map](/wiki/Map "Map").
  * At the edge of the Map just before you start taking the "out of bound" damage, build [Industrial Storage Containers](/wiki/Industrial_Storage_Container "Industrial Storage Container") and chain them together with belts and [Conveyor Lifts](/wiki/Conveyor_Lift "Conveyor Lift"). 
    * When the storage of the last Container is full, the items will start filling up the second last Container, and so on.
    * Stack the Containers by building them on top of each other. The direction of the Container should be alternated for each layer.
    * Test the storage by inserting an item into the first Container and make sure it can flow to the last Container.
    * The maximum Nuclear Waste production rate is `50 × 5 = 250 / min`, and an Industrial Storage Container can store `48 × 500 = 24000`. Each container adds 1.6 hours to the storage capacity. Build about 100 Containers.
  * There are myths about storing waste in [vehicles](/wiki/Vehicle "Vehicle"), then dumping the vehicles into the [void](/wiki/Void "Void") will remove the items. That method will not work.
  * Briefly connect the Nuclear Power to the main power grid to start the Water Extractors, then disconnect it again. This is to prime the Nuclear Power Plants.
  * Check if the Nuclear Power generates 125 GW. Allow plenty of time to let the [Nuclear Fuel Rods](/wiki/Nuclear_Fuel_Rod "Nuclear Fuel Rod") fill up the buffers in each Nuclear Power Plant to reach the maximum capacity. 
    * Alternatively, you may manually split the [stacks](/wiki/Stack "Stack") and distribute the [NFRs](/wiki/NFR "NFR") to each Power Plant.
    * Once it reaches 125 GW, you can reconnect the Nuclear Power to the main [power grid](/wiki/Power_grid "Power grid"). This is to ensure that there is no fault in the system. (check the setup if it never reaches 125 GW)
    * Congratulations! This 125 GW Nuclear Power should last for hundreds of hours before we have to revisit this area to expand it.
    * Optional: De-commission the [Turbofuel](/wiki/Turbofuel "Turbofuel") Power. However, since we have no [Oil](/wiki/Oil "Oil") shortage at the moment, we can leave it to operate for a long time.

### Oil Processing 2

  * We have been using a simple but inefficient method to produce [Plastic](/wiki/Plastic "Plastic") and [Rubber](/wiki/Rubber "Rubber"). The existing production rates are 220 Plastic/min and 140 Rubber/min.
  * To prepare for scaling up the production of [Computers](/wiki/Computer "Computer") and [Supercomputers](/wiki/Supercomputer "Supercomputer"), we will need to bump up the production of Plastic and Rubber to at least 900/min each.
  * We will use a similar strategy as the [Turbofuel](/wiki/Turbofuel "Turbofuel") Power, where [Empty Canisters](/wiki/Empty_Canister "Empty Canister") get recycled as part of the Diluted [Packaged Fuel](/wiki/Packaged_Fuel "Packaged Fuel") chain. 
    * As the Empty Canister item rate is 800/min, which is more than 780/min, divide the loop into 2.
  * Prime each Empty Canister loop by inserting a sufficient amount of Empty Canisters into a [Storage Container](/wiki/Storage_Container "Storage Container"), built in-line with the loop. Ensure every [Packaged Water](/wiki/Packaged_Water "Packaged Water") [Refinery](/wiki/Refineries "Refineries") is receiving Empty Canisters at all times. 
    * In this example, 25 [stacks](/wiki/Stack "Stack") of Empty Canister are provided to each loop.
  * We will also use the Recycled Plastic and Recycled Rubber recipes; they essentially produce one Plastic or one Rubber from 1 m³ of Fuel input.
  * All [Polymer Resin](/wiki/Polymer_Resin "Polymer Resin") will be converted to Rubber instead of Plastic for maximum efficiency.
  * We will build according to the schematic as shown below.
  * For Plastic production, route half of the Plastic output back to Recycled Rubber Refineries and send the overflowing Plastic to the output belt. A similar approach applies to Rubber production.
  * As the net output is 900 Plastic (or Rubber) / min, two belts are needed for each final product. 
    * One belt will be carrying 780 / min, the other carrying 120 / min. We have to label each belt as to distinguish them, or,
    * To make parallel belts easier to manage, build a 2:2 belt [balancer](/wiki/Balancer "Balancer") at the end of the production line, as shown below.

  * Test the factory in two-steps: 
    * First is the running test. [Sink](/wiki/Sink "Sink") all the products and check all [buildings](/wiki/Building "Building") are running at 100%.
    * Second step is the ability to clear the backlogged items when unpaused: this is only needed for factories involving byproducts. Remove the Sinks and let the entire production fully back up, then sink the output again. If the factory can resume the operation by itself without getting deadlocked, that means the design is successful.
  * If you have tested the Plastic setup, observe that the whole system goes into a deadlock state after some time: the [Polymer Resin](/wiki/Polymer_Resin "Polymer Resin") backs up, stopping the [HOR](/wiki/HOR "HOR") production and thus shutting down the whole line. 
    * As a safety precaution, set up an overflow system for the [Polymer Resin](/wiki/Polymer_Resin "Polymer Resin") using [Smart Splitter](/wiki/Smart_Splitter "Smart Splitter") and [AWESOME Sink](/wiki/AWESOME_Sink "AWESOME Sink").
    * For Rubber production, overflow all the residual Rubber to the output belt to prevent clogging.
  * Once the Plastic production is up and running, proceed to build the Rubber production.
  * We will re-use the [Railway](/wiki/Railway "Railway") connecting the [Aluminum](/wiki/Aluminum "Aluminum") outpost and the base. 
    * Build a 4-wagon [Train Station](/wiki/Train_Station "Train Station") at the Oil outpost and merge the Railway to the Alclad Aluminum station from its free end.
    * Alternatively, you may build a dedicated Railway between the Oil outpost and the base.
  * Near the base, split the Railway and build another station for unloading of Plastic and Rubber. 
    * A Railway split can be created by connecting another Railway to an existing joint of two Railways. You cannot create a split in the middle of a section of a Railway.
    * A [Railroad Switch Control](/wiki/Railroad_Switch_Control "Railroad Switch Control") is automatically created at the split way. You can leave it untouched as Trains in automatic mode ignore the switches.
  * When merging Train networks, do not mix 1-way Trains and 2-way Trains, as this will mess up the entire setup. Trains may turn around unexpectedly, potentially causing item mixing on belts. 
    * Trains can clip through with each other without issue, meaning there will be no collision between a Train and anything else.
  * The round trip time of this train will be more than 4min 06sec. However, this is not an issue as we only need each wagon to transport 450 items/min; hence the max allowed round-trip time is `T = 32 Stack * (100 items/stack) / (450 items/min) = 7.1 minutes or 7m 6s`
  * Connect the Train unloading Station to an [ISC](/wiki/ISC "ISC") then belt it to the Computer and Supercomputer productions.
  * De-commission the old Oil production by removing the input Oil [Pipe](/wiki/Pipe "Pipe") and the [Power Line](/wiki/Power_Line "Power Line"). You may dismantle the old [buildings](/wiki/Building "Building") or just leave it there. 
    * Dismantle the two belts connecting the Oil [Islands](/wiki/Islands "Islands") and the base.
    * Dismantling the unused buildings generally improves the game's performance.

### Trains and Ingot Refineries

  * This section introduces the idea of transitioning from a standard-scale base to a megabase. 
    * Instead of simply following each step below, pause a moment after reading and comprehend each part, trying to figure out the meaning of performing each step.
    * As always, be creative. If you have different ideas, go ahead and try them out! There are infinite ways to play the game.
  * Use the [Online Map](/wiki/Online_tools#Save_editor "Online tools") to search for Pure and Normal nodes of [Iron Ore](/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore"), [Copper Ore](/wiki/Copper_Ore "Copper Ore"), [Caterium Ore](/wiki/Caterium_Ore "Caterium Ore") and [Raw Quartz](/wiki/Raw_Quartz "Raw Quartz"). 
    * Impure nodes are fine too–simply combine two of them into one belt and treat them as a belt of 600/min.
  * We will build several mining outposts mainly in the northern part of the [World](/wiki/World "World") such as at the [Northern Forest](/wiki/Northern_Forest "Northern Forest"), [Desert Canyons](/wiki/Desert_Canyons "Desert Canyons"), [Titan Forest](/wiki/Titan_Forest "Titan Forest"), and [Swamp](/wiki/Swamp "Swamp"). 
    * The locations of the selected [Resource Nodes](/wiki/Resource_Node "Resource Node") are just an example. You may pick any other locations according to your preference.
  * Transport the ore to the North [Sea](/wiki/Sea "Sea") and process them into their respective ingots, using [Alternate: Pure ingot recipe](/wiki/Alternate_Recipes "Alternate Recipes").
  * We will build a [Train](/wiki/Train "Train") network consisting of several Trains moving between the mining outposts and the main [Refinery](/wiki/Refinery "Refinery") area.
  * There is a large [Oil](/wiki/Oil "Oil") patch at the North. Reserve some space for future Plastic and Rubber production.
  * For each type of resource, build arrays of Refineries and [Water Extractors](/wiki/Water_Extractor "Water Extractor") with the correct ratio. The refined ingots are to be transported away via Trains, which we will build later. 
    * Use an Online [Calculator](/wiki/Calculator "Calculator") to find out the ratio of Refineries to Water Extractors for each [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt").
  * Build three platforms at different heights: The Refineries and Water Extractors on the [sea](/wiki/Sea "Sea") level, the belt transfer platform above it, and the Train platform above the belt platform. 
    * You can adjust the height of each platform to your preference, as long as they do not encroach each other.
    * The belt platform and Train platform need not be constructed at full size. Only build the necessary [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations") to provide support for the buildings.
  * For the Train setup, assign clusters of [Resource Nodes](/wiki/Resource_Node "Resource Node") to be grouped as a mining outpost. For each mining outpost, build a Train station with two [Freight Platforms](/wiki/Freight_Platform "Freight Platform") assigned for each resource belt. 
    * This is because the Train's round-trip time is likely to fall between 4m 06s and 8m 12s. If the round trip time is beyond 8m 12s, you need three Freight Platforms for each resource belt.
    * Size the Train to match the Train Station. Add additional [Locomotives](/wiki/Electric_Locomotive "Electric Locomotive") at the end of the Train to increase the Train's traction if necessary.
    * An alternative approach is to increase the number of Trains instead of its length; in that way, each Train and Train Station will be shorter, but with more Trains running on each route.
  * Build a matching unloading Station at the Refinery area for each mining outpost. To simplify the setup, only use 1-way Trains. End-of-line loops are required for every train station. You can also combine all the loops and only construct a single, common Railway, as shown below.
  * For the Ingots produced from Refinery blocks, use [Belt compressors](/wiki/Balancer#Belt_compressor "Balancer") shown below to manage [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt") overflows. 
    * You may need to create an Excel calculation for this part.
    * Read [Balancer#Belt compressor](/wiki/Balancer#Belt_compressor "Balancer") for more details.

  * [](/wiki/File:Managing_resources_with_train_schematic.png "The schematic of the Train schedules for this setup.")

The schematic of the [Train](/wiki/Train "Train") schedules for this setup.



  * Prior to the construction of the Refinery layout, have an overview of the resources below:

Ore Belt | [Iron Ore](/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore") | [Copper Ore](/wiki/Copper_Ore "Copper Ore") | [Caterium Ore](/wiki/Caterium_Ore "Caterium Ore") | [Raw Quartz](/wiki/Raw_Quartz "Raw Quartz")  
---|---|---|---|---  
Pure (780) | 11 | 4 | 1 | 0   
Normal (600) | 3 | 1 | 3 | 6   
No. of Refinery blocks | 14 | 10* | 8* | 6   
  
  * We can then base on this to tile the layout of Refinery blocks for each type of resource. 
    * The Copper and Caterium Ingots will require lots of Refineries for each belt of ore; split each refinery block into two for easier construction.
  * Based on their ore to pure ingot conversion ratios, we can expect the following output: 
    * _To find out their ore to ingot conversion ratios, go to the wiki page of individual ingots and study the alternate recipes._

Item | [Iron Ingot](/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot") | [Copper Ingot](/wiki/Copper_Ingot "Copper Ingot") | [Copper Sheet](/wiki/Copper_Sheet "Copper Sheet") | [Caterium Ingot](/wiki/Caterium_Ingot "Caterium Ingot") | [Quartz Crystal](/wiki/Quartz_Crystal "Quartz Crystal")  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
No. of belts | 24.7 | 8 | 3.9 | 1.7 | 3.6   
Freight platform per belt | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1   
Train configuration | 2-25 | 2-8 | 1-4 | 2-6   
No. of trains | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2   
  
  * A train configuration of 2-25 means two forward [Electric Locomotives](/wiki/Electric_Locomotive "Electric Locomotive") \+ 25 [Freight Cars](/wiki/Freight_Car "Freight Car"). Another example: 1-4-1 means one forward Locomotive + 4 Freight Cars + one backward Locomotive. 
    * As all the Trains will be of a 1-way type, only build one leading Locomotive at the front and build the remaining Locomotives at the back, all facing the forward direction. This can minimize the footprint of the Train Stations.
  * We can then size the output Train according to the number of belts, with two Freight Cars for each belt of ingots. We can either build a single, long Train or multiple shorter Trains. 
    * Each Freight Car must only contain one type of resource.
    * A Train can have multiple Freight Cars of mixed resources.
  * If there are multiple Trains on the same route, space them out based on 'equal temporal' to achieve the maximum throughput. 
    * If there are two Trains on the same route, each Train should arrive at different Stations at the same time. When they move, they should meet at the midpoint of their schedule.
    * Observe the [Map](/wiki/Map "Map") and the Locomotive icons. To time the trains, activate the 'Auto-pilot' of the 2nd Train when the first has reached the opposite Station.
    * Using a longer Train instead of multiple shorter Trains per route is more reliable. The timing of the trains can deviate when there is nothing to load/unload at one of the Freight Platforms.
  * When constructing parallel Train Stations, their end-of-line loops can be combined into a single return Railway as shown below. 
    * _For the construction of the Railway curves, see[Railway#Building of curved section](/wiki/Railway#Building_of_curved_section "Railway")._
  * After completing the Refinery and the Train Station layouts, the last step is to connect them with Conveyor Lifts and belts, and make sure each of the Freight Platforms is filled with the correct item type.
  * By uploading the [save files](/wiki/Save_files "Save files") to the [Online Map](/wiki/Online_tools#Save_editors "Online tools"), check if all the buildings are working properly. Mouse hover each building to check their status. 
    * Check if buildings are properly connected with [Power Lines](/wiki/Power_Line "Power Line"), [Conveyor Belts](/wiki/Conveyor_Belts "Conveyor Belts"), and [Pipelines](/wiki/Pipelines "Pipelines").

    * 1 / 3 for Steamed [Copper Sheets](/wiki/Copper_Sheet "Copper Sheet"): They require [Water](/wiki/Water "Water") to be produced, and hence we will build the [Copper Sheet](/wiki/Copper_Sheet "Copper Sheet") production area nearby, on the [sea](/wiki/Sea "Sea") level.
    * 2 / 3 for [Wire](/wiki/Wire "Wire") and Fused [Quickwires](/wiki/Quickwire "Quickwire").
  * Trains will be used to transport out the Copper Ingots and Copper Sheets away from the Refinery area.



### Steel Production 3

  * Revisit the [Steel](/wiki/Steel "Steel") outpost and create a Pure [Iron Ingot](/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot") [Refinery](/wiki/Refinery "Refinery") area over the small lake near the three [Iron](/wiki/Iron "Iron") nodes.
  * 4.5 belts of Solid [Steel Ingots](/wiki/Steel_Ingot "Steel Ingot") can be produced from three belts of [Iron Ores](/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore").
  * Export the following Steel products via [Trains](/wiki/Train "Train"): 
    * 20 [Steel Beam](/wiki/Steel_Beam "Steel Beam") / min and 2286 [Steel Pipe](/wiki/Steel_Pipe "Steel Pipe") / min.
    * Exporting Steel products instead of Steel Ingots can save the Train's bandwidth, because both [Steel Pipes](/wiki/Steel_Pipe "Steel Pipe") and [Steel Beams](/wiki/Steel_Beam "Steel Beam") have higher compression compared to Steel Ingot.
  * The intermediate steps will not be shown here as an exercise for the reader.



### Silica

  * The last remaining ingredient for producing [Turbo Motors](/wiki/Turbo_Motor "Turbo Motor") is the [Silica](/wiki/Silica "Silica").
  * Use the [online map](/wiki/Online_tools#save_editors "Online tools") to find a suitable location to set up the Silica outpost: 
    * It turns out the void near the [Grass Fields](/wiki/Grass_Fields "Grass Fields") is a good candidate, as it has both [Quartz](/wiki/Quartz "Quartz") and [Limestone](/wiki/Limestone "Limestone") nodes nearby.
  * Construct a floating platform there, about the same height as the two Quartz nodes. The Limestone nodes are positioned on lower ground, but we can bring them up with [Conveyor Lifts](/wiki/Conveyor_Lift "Conveyor Lift").
  * Extend the [Railway](/wiki/Railway "Railway") from the [Uranium](/wiki/Uranium "Uranium") mining outpost to the Silica outpost to reuse the existing Railway.
  * At the other end, connect the Uranium, [Steel](/wiki/Steel "Steel"), and [Refinery](/wiki/Refinery "Refinery") Railway to form a unified [Train](/wiki/Train "Train") network.


  * [](/wiki/File:Online_map_Silica_location.png "The two normal Quartz nodes can produce 3.6 belts of Silica. Limestone nodes can be found nearby. Reuse the existing Railways where possible.")

### Motors 2

  * In the Esc menu -> Options, increase the auto-save interval to 12 minutes to reduce waiting time (auto-save induces lag). You may need to turn down the graphic quality as the factory grows. 
    * Minimize the use of [Glass Foundations](/wiki/Glass_Foundation "Glass Foundation") and [Windows](/wiki/Window "Window") to reduce lag.
  * Our next goal is to mass-produce [Turbo Motors](/wiki/Turbo_Motor "Turbo Motor"), then construct a mall. 
    * With our current production rate of various ingots, we can first aim to produce 40 Turbo Motors/min.
    * 'Mall' refers to a centralized [Storage](/wiki/Storage_Container "Storage Container") where various [building](/wiki/Building "Building") materials produced by factories are stored.
  * By looking at the [Map](/wiki/Map "Map"), observe that the [Lake Forest](/wiki/Lake_Forest "Lake Forest") is positioned just about at the center of the map, which is a good location for our late-game production hub.
  * We will also build a [Train](/wiki/Train "Train") hub here to receive all the refined materials at various outposts.
  * Build production floors before constructing the unloading [Train Stations](/wiki/Train_Station "Train Station"). We need the Train Stations to unload the right material next to the factories that require them. 
    * This will greatly reduce the [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt") spaghetti connecting the Train Stations and the factories.
  * There are many steps involved in producing the Turbo Motors entirely with alternate recipes, but let's start with the [Stators](/wiki/Stator "Stator") and [Motors](/wiki/Motor "Motor"). 
    * Split the production of Stators into two groups: one for feeding Motors and the remaining feeding the Turbo Motors.
  * Build a 5-floor factory based on the schematic below. The 1st floor will be Motors, the 2nd floor will be [Rotors](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor"), and the 3rd floor for Stators. 
    * The 4th and 6th floors will be the belt-transfer floors. The 5th floor will be the Train unloading Station.
  * Separate the Motor setup into multiple smaller modules. Use trial and error to design a production module. 
    * After the module is constructed, test it by feeding the ingredients via temporary [Containers](/wiki/Container "Container").
    * Make sure the module is working before building more copies of it.
  * Production facilities for other components will be built on the 6th floor and above.

  * Once the Motor production is up and running, sink the produced Motors to start farming the [AWESOME points](/wiki/AWESOME_Sink "AWESOME Sink").



### Supercomputer 2

  * In this section, aim to produce 22.22 [Supercomputers](/wiki/Supercomputer "Supercomputer")/min.
  * Build additional floors above the [Train Station](/wiki/Train_Station "Train Station") floor. 
    * The 6th floor is the [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt") transfer floor.
    * Start from the 7th floor and build the following setup according to your own preferences. As most items involve multiple belts, try to build in a modular fashion to avoid the need to build parallel belts.
    * In this example, the 7th floor is for [High-Speed Connectors](/wiki/High-Speed_Connector "High-Speed Connector"), 8th floor for [Computers](/wiki/Computer "Computer"), and 9th floor for [A.I. Limiters](/wiki/A.I._Limiter "A.I. Limiter") and [Supercomputers](/wiki/Supercomputer "Supercomputer").
  * Keep the belts involving [Quickwire](/wiki/Quickwire "Quickwire") as short as possible: 
    * Group seven Quickwire [Assemblers](/wiki/Assembler "Assembler") and three High-Speed Connector [Manufacturers](/wiki/Manufacturer "Manufacturer"). For the Computer, split the Quickwire belt in 2; each feeds into six Manufacturers.
    * By building one additional [Assembler](/wiki/Assembler "Assembler") crafting [A.I. Limiters](/wiki/A.I._Limiter "A.I. Limiter"), we can make the Quickwire-to-A.I. Limiter building ratio 1:1, simplifying the setup.
  * Use [Conveyor Lifts](/wiki/Conveyor_Lift "Conveyor Lift") to bring the [High-Speed Connectors](/wiki/High-Speed_Connector "High-Speed Connector") and [Computers](/wiki/Computer "Computer") to the upper floor, feeding the Supercomputer production. 
    * Dismantle some of the Foundations where the Lifts are positioned.
    * [Walkway Crossings](/wiki/Walkway_Crossing "Walkway Crossing") can be used to patch up the holes in the platform. Although not visually appealing, they reduce the chance of falling through the holes.
  * Build Train Stations to unload [Plastic](/wiki/Plastic "Plastic"), [Rubber](/wiki/Rubber "Rubber"), and [Alclad Aluminum Sheet](/wiki/Alclad_Aluminum_Sheet "Alclad Aluminum Sheet"). Disconnect the Railway connecting their outpost to the old base and divert both Railways to unload here instead. 
    * Modify the Train Stations and the Trains from 2-way to 1-way. Build end-of-line loops at the loading Train Stations at the [Aluminum](/wiki/Aluminum "Aluminum") and [Oil](/wiki/Oil "Oil") areas.
    * Avoid mixing 1-way and 2-way Trains in the same network.
    * Generally, in a rail network, 1-way Trains are more reliable than 2-way Trains.

  * Continue building upper floors for the final steps of automating [Turbo Motors](/wiki/Turbo_Motor "Turbo Motor").



### Turbo Motors 2

  * With most of the preparation work done, the [Turbo Motors](/wiki/Turbo_Motor "Turbo Motor") are ready to be produced.
  * Build another two floors above the [Supercomputer](/wiki/Supercomputer "Supercomputer") production. 
    * The 10th floor is for [A.I. Limiters](/wiki/A.I._Limiter "A.I. Limiter") and [Heat Sinks](/wiki/Heat_Sink "Heat Sink").
    * The 11th floor is for [Radio Control Units](/wiki/Radio_Control_Unit "Radio Control Unit") and [Turbo Motors](/wiki/Turbo_Motor "Turbo Motor").
  * Build a [Sink](/wiki/Sink "Sink") at the Turbo Motor output belt–do not [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") the Sink yet.
  * Let the entire factory run for a couple of hours to allow all ingredients to fill up the buffers of all machines, then Power the Sink. While the machines are running, search for bottlenecks or faults. 
    * Using the [Online map](/wiki/Online_tools#save_editors "Online tools") is a quick way to check on all the machines' status.
  * Check if all the [Trains](/wiki/Train "Train") are working properly. 
    * Currently there is a glitch where Trains may stop working or be unable to find the next stop for no reason. You may have to manually enter the Train and get it unstuck.
    * Our most important Train is the [Uranium](/wiki/Uranium "Uranium") Train. Make sure it is running!
  * Some of our Train schedules have two or more Trains running on the same route. Make sure they are spaced out equally, otherwise the throughput will be reduced. 
    * Refer to the previous section to recall how to time the Trains.
    * If you face difficulty timing the Trains, consider adding additional Trains to the same route.

### A proper mall and warehouse

  * Before abandoning the old base, prepare to shift our main operation area to the [Lake Forest](/wiki/Lake_Forest "Lake Forest") by constructing a mall there.
  * Build the mall beside the Turbo Motor production.
  * Produce the following: 
    * [](/wiki/Iron_Rod "Iron Rod") [Iron Rod](/wiki/Iron_Rod "Iron Rod"): 20 / min
    * [](/wiki/Iron_Plate "Iron Plate") [Iron Plate](/wiki/Iron_Plate "Iron Plate"): 20 / min

  * Another material is optional, as we only include material involved in construction or equipment crafting.
  * Expand the mining network to cope with the increased consumption.
  * Expand the various production outposts, particularly the [Oil](/wiki/Oil "Oil") and [Aluminum](/wiki/Aluminum "Aluminum") outposts since we have already maximized their usage.
  * When [Power](/wiki/Power "Power") consumption exceeds 60% of the Power capacity, expand the Nuclear Power setup. 
    * Re-visit the [Nuclear Waste](/wiki/Nuclear_Waste "Nuclear Waste") Storage area and increase the buffer size where required. Consider relocating the Storage to the North-East corner of the [Map](/wiki/Map "Map") at 1.5km above sea level.
    * Build at least 1000 [Industrial Storage Containers](/wiki/Industrial_Storage_Container "Industrial Storage Container") for that.
  * Build the mall storage at the topmost floor, with all the production factories on the lower floors.
  * Build at least two Industrial Storage Containers for storing each item. Building too much storage is not advised as it may create difficulties when future alterations are required. 
    * Label each Container by building a 1-meter short [belt](/wiki/Belt "Belt") out from its output.
  * Build a [Hyper Tube Cannon](/wiki/Hyper_Tube_Cannon "Hyper Tube Cannon") Hub at the top floor as well, with eight cannons facing eight directions of the Map.
  * Re-align the Hyper Tube Cannon at each outpost to the new base.
  * Once the mall is up and running, de-commission the old base. Recycle or [Sink](/wiki/Sink "Sink") the excess materials. 
    * Add the [Resource Nodes](/wiki/Resource_Node "Resource Node") near the old base to the Train network as well.



### Turbo Motors 3

  * [Turbo Motor](/wiki/Turbo_Motor "Turbo Motor") is the most efficient item for farming [AWESOME Points](/wiki/AWESOME_Sink "AWESOME Sink").
  * The theoretical maximum production rate of Turbo Motor is 156 / min, which is bottle-necked by the number of [Bauxite](/wiki/Bauxite "Bauxite") nodes on the [Map](/wiki/Map "Map").
  * As we have to keep a reserve of [Alclad Aluminum Sheets](/wiki/Alclad_Aluminum_Sheet "Alclad Aluminum Sheet") for building [Conveyor Belt Mk.5](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt_Mk.5 "Conveyor Belt Mk.5"), aim for 153 Turbo Motors/min instead.



### Golden Nut

  * Once a sufficient number of [Coupons](/wiki/Coupon "Coupon") is obtained, buy all the [Statues](/wiki/Statues "Statues") you can afford, including the [](/wiki/Golden_Nut "Golden Nut") [Golden Nut](/wiki/Golden_Nut "Golden Nut").
  * Statues can be bought multiple times as long as you can afford them.
  * Other than building the factory, set your own custom objectives: Taming all the [Lizard Doggos](/wiki/Lizard_Doggo "Lizard Doggo") in the [World](/wiki/World "World"), collecting 100% of the [Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug"), [Somersloops](/wiki/Somersloop "Somersloop"), and [Mercer Spheres](/wiki/Mercer_Sphere "Mercer Sphere"), etc. 
    * There are currently some issues that disallow the collection of some items due to encroachment issues. Consider using the clipping trick that we have learned earlier.
  * There are many [caves](/wiki/Cave "Cave") that we have yet to explore–each contains its own reward.
  * You may also start to consider building aesthetically, using various types of [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations")/[Walls](/wiki/Walls "Walls") and touching up with the [Color Gun](/wiki/Color_Gun "Color Gun"). 
    * Use the [online map](/wiki/Online_tools#Save_editors "Online tools") to create fancy Foundation shapes such as circular Foundations, etc.
  * There are also unofficial [Mods](/wiki/Mods "Mods") that add fan-made content into the game. Try them out!



## Tips and Tricks

  * In the early game, pick up leaves as you walk. They are essential biomass as an early-game power source.
  * Almost every resource patch is guarded by creatures such as [Fluffy-tailed Hogs](/wiki/Fluffy-tailed_Hog "Fluffy-tailed Hog"). Approach with caution and kill them. Pay attention to the sound they make.
  * Remove the deposits that rest on the Resource Node so that you can place a [Miner](/wiki/Miner "Miner") on it. You need to hand-mine it. The deposit gives you 50-100+ ores.
  * Leave sufficient space between buildings so that you can connect them with [belts](/wiki/Belt "Belt") later.
  * After placing a [Constructor](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor"), buffer it with a [Storage Container](/wiki/Storage_Container "Storage Container") by placing one after it to have a consistent supply of components ready to go.
  * Watch out for power demand. Make sure the power capacity is always higher than the peak power demand.
  * A [Power Pole](/wiki/Power_Pole "Power Pole") has four connections: two for buildings and two for chaining to other poles. Later in the game, you will have better [Power Poles](/wiki/Power_Poles "Power Poles").
  * You can align your buildings by looking for the thick green lines. Build [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations") for easier snapping.
  * Be creative. Use [belts](/wiki/Belt "Belt"), [ladders](/wiki/Ladder "Ladder"), or [foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations") to reach hard-to-access areas.
  * The quickest route to [coal power](/wiki/Coal_Generator "Coal Generator") is Hub Upgrade 6 -> Part Assembly (Tier 2) -> [Space Elevator](/wiki/Space_Elevator "Space Elevator") first delivery -> Coal Power. After getting the coal power set up, come back and complete the Tier 1 [Milestones](/wiki/Milestones "Milestones"). 
    * You will still need [Tier 1](/wiki/Tier_1 "Tier 1") \- Logistics to effectively split the [coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal"), though.
  * Use the [Conveyor Pole Stackable](/wiki/Conveyor_Pole_Stackable "Conveyor Pole Stackable") & [Conveyor Lifts](/wiki/Conveyor_Lift "Conveyor Lift") for elevated conveyors combined with [Splitter](/wiki/Splitter "Splitter") for the most efficient use of ground space.
  * While your factory is slowly crafting the parts, you could bring your [weapon](/wiki/Combat "Combat") and [explore](/wiki/Map "Map") the [World](/wiki/World "World").
  * Some collectibles are located on high ground. Others are hidden inside caves.
  * When taking a screenshot in the photo mode (default [`P`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")), the screenshot will be saved at `Documents\My Games\FactoryGame\Screenshot`. Un-equipping the [handheld item](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") before entering photo mode allows for an unobstructed screenshot.
  * You can use photo mode as binoculars by zooming in (use the [`Mouse wheel`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to change the FOV).
  * Do not panic if you get yourself killed; you can always make your way back to the location of the death to get back your items. They are stored in the [crate](/wiki/Crate "Crate").
  * Swimming is considerably slower than repeatedly jumping out of the water. Without [Blade Runners](/wiki/Blade_Runners "Blade Runners"), this method is approx. 1.5 - two times faster. With Blade Runners, this method is 2.5 - three times faster than regular swimming.[6]
  * Search for waterfalls. Who knows what might be behind them.
