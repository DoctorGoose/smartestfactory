# Tutorial:Production line design tips

This page is dedicated to useful tips to help design production lines. This does not include item optimization information, as optimal production lines are covered on each items individual page.   
  
A production line of [Motors](/wiki/Motor "Motor"), [Rotors](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor") and [Stators](/wiki/Stator "Stator") are commonly discussed as an example throughout this page. Consider reading up on these items before reading further.

## Research, Progression and Alternate Recipes

### Late Game Items and Buildings

[Mk.6 Conveyor Belts](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt "Conveyor Belt") allow the maximum throughput of items attainable in game, which aids in delivering on a large scale. Because of this, scaling up to larger builds should wait until items can compactly transport the required inputs/outputs at that scale. Early game, consider building smaller factories to attain the required items for progression as soon as possible, and redesigning end-game factories at a larger scale once [Tier 7 / 8 or Tier 9](/wiki/Milestones "Milestones") is unlocked. 

### Alternate Recipes

Utilizing [alternate recipes](/wiki/Alternate "Alternate") can have a large impact on designing a factory. As the player approaches mid-game it is advised [Hard Drives](/wiki/Hard_Drive "Hard Drive") should be sought out to acquire these. 

#### Resource Optimization

Alternate recipes allow less valuable resources (Eg [Iron Ingots](/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot") into [Iron Wire](/wiki/Wire "Wire") saving on [Copper](/wiki/Copper_Ingot "Copper Ingot")), and/or better input to output ratios ([Solid Steel Ingots](/wiki/Steel_Ingot "Steel Ingot") have better resource efficiency than [Steel Ingots](/wiki/Steel_Ingot "Steel Ingot")). Utilizing these, the maximum potential of all resources in the game can be reached to produce the maximum amount of throughput. 

#### Production Simplification

Alternate recipes, especially those utilizing [Crystal Oscillators](/wiki/Crystal_Oscillator "Crystal Oscillator"), can simplify production lines. (Eg [Computers](/wiki/Computer "Computer") can go from 4 ingredients in a [Manufacturer](/wiki/Manufacturer "Manufacturer"), to 2 ingredients in an [Assembler](/wiki/Assembler "Assembler")) 

Most recipes also deliver resource optimization, allowing a smaller number of buildings overall. Additionally they can use less complex components minimizing production lines leading up. 

#### Number of Unique Items and Input Simplification

Alternate recipes allow less number of unique items required in a production line 

For example, [Rotor](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor") and [Stator](/wiki/Stator "Stator") default recipes require 3 unique inputs and 5 unique manufactured items 

  * [Iron Ingot](/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot") into [Iron Rod](/wiki/Iron_Rod "Iron Rod") into [Screws](/wiki/Screw "Screw")
  * [Iron Ingot](/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot") and [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal") into [Steel Ingot](/wiki/Steel_Ingot "Steel Ingot") into [Steel Pipes](/wiki/Steel_Pipe "Steel Pipe")
  * [Copper Ingot](/wiki/Copper_Ingot "Copper Ingot") into [Wire](/wiki/Wire "Wire")



Utilizing the [Steel Rotor](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor") and [Iron Wire](/wiki/Wire "Wire") alternate recipes, this can be simplified to 2 unique inputs, and 3 unique manufactures items 

  * [Iron Ingot](/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot") into [Iron Wire](/wiki/Wire "Wire")
  * [Iron Ingot](/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot") and [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal") into [Steel Ingot](/wiki/Steel_Ingot "Steel Ingot") into [Steel Pipes](/wiki/Steel_Pipe "Steel Pipe")



## Modularizing

Early game players can experience the temptation to build large scale factories to deliver early-game components en-masse. This should be avoided, and smaller, tileable production lines for mid-to-late game components should be used instead. 

However, when building end-game factories from scratch for low-throughput goals, it is also acceptable to build each space elevator item from scratch, as it is sufficient to source resources from local nodes, at a smaller production scale. Exceptions to this rule are listed below. At higher production scales, it is equally advisable to create central factories or warehouses for products of spread-out resources, such as nitrogen. 

When determining the size of a production line, consider the below: 

### Limiting Input Rates

Consider creating as few input belts as possible. A good starting place can be to limit any particular input to within 780 items/min (a [Mk5 Conveyor Belt](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt "Conveyor Belt")). However this doesn't necessarily mean a limit of 780/min of one item type. 

For example, a module with the following recipes 

  * [Iron Ingot](/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot") into [Iron Wire](/wiki/Wire "Wire")
  * [Iron Ingot](/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot") and [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal") into [Steel Ingot](/wiki/Steel_Ingot "Steel Ingot") into [Steel Pipe](/wiki/Steel_Pipe "Steel Pipe")
  * [Steel Pipe](/wiki/Steel_Pipe "Steel Pipe") and [Iron Wire](/wiki/Wire "Wire") into [Rotors](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor")



This production line requires 2 inputs of [Iron Ingots](/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot") (1 for [Iron Wire](/wiki/Wire "Wire"), 1 for [Steel Ingots](/wiki/Steel_Ingot "Steel Ingot")) and [Coal](/wiki/Coal "Coal") (dedicated to [Steel Ingot](/wiki/Steel_Ingot "Steel Ingot")), all accomplishable within three 780 items/min/belt. 

Limiting inputs as much as possible helps when expanding. Building additional modules that require a large number of belts means acquiring a proportional number of resources before being effective. 

Additionally, this helps finding space to get belts to the starting point of a production line. If a module requires a large number of belts, adding modules means finding space for these belts or start the production line elsewhere. A smaller number of belts can optimize any space between or within modules without 'only fitting in 9 out of the 10 belts needed' 

### Item Compression

As resources go through stages of production, they can be compressed into a smaller number of items. 

For example 

  * 15 [Iron Ingot](/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot")/min into 15 [Iron Rod](/wiki/Iron_Rod "Iron Rod")/min: 1 : 1 (no compression)
  * 10 [Iron Rod](/wiki/Iron_Rod "Iron Rod")/min into 40 [Screw](/wiki/Screw "Screw")/min: 1 : 4 inflation
  * 20 [Iron Rod](/wiki/Iron_Rod "Iron Rod") (20 [Iron Ingot](/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot")) + 100 [Screw](/wiki/Screw "Screw")/min (25 [Iron Ingot](/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot")) into 4 [Rotor](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor")/min: 45 : 4 compression



Producing a dedicated [Rotor](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor") factory allows 45 [Iron Ingots](/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot") to be compressed into 4 [Rotors](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor") for export. In comparison, a dedicated [Screw](/wiki/Screw "Screw") factory causes larger strain on the logistic network by increasing the output ratio. 

Once a production line with a fair compression ratio has been designed, consider exporting this onto a larger logistics network, such as [Trains](/wiki/Electric_Locomotive "Electric Locomotive") or [Trucks](/wiki/Truck "Truck"). Compressed items generally have smaller item/min requirements proceeding recipes, making them easier to transport to meet the needs of other factories. 

### Space Compression

Using standard recipes, a perfectly balanced [Rotor](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor") production line requires 

  * 18 [Iron Rod](/wiki/Iron_Rod "Iron Rod") [Constructors](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor")
  * 15 [Screw](/wiki/Screw "Screw") [Constructors](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor")
  * 6 [Rotor](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor") [Assemblers](/wiki/Assembler "Assembler")



Taking up 3,540m2 for machinery to produce 4 items/min. Inserting this into a larger endgame factory can be difficult, while inserting a smaller [Screw](/wiki/Screw "Screw") [Constructors](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor") into other production lines would be less impactful. 

### Production line stages

Consider limiting the number of stages within a production line, eg [Copper Ingot](/wiki/Copper_Ingot "Copper Ingot") into [Wire](/wiki/Wire "Wire") into [Stator](/wiki/Stator "Stator") has 3 stages while turning [Stators](/wiki/Stator "Stator") into [Motors](/wiki/Motor "Motor") has 4 stages. Consider at which stage it would be best to send items to separate factories to continue processing. 

Minimizing stages in a factory has the following benefits: 

  * Mid-production line items (eg [Rotors](/wiki/Rotor "Rotor") and [Stators](/wiki/Stator "Stator")) can be expanded and tapped into directly for export.
  * End-of-line items are mutually exclusive to mid-line item production, allowing old production lines that now have better alternatives to be reconstructed, without needing to rebuild an end-to-end production line.
  * Additional required simple components (eg [Screws](/wiki/Screw "Screw")) can be easily inserted into detached production lines closer to their end-of-line machinery.



It is strongly recommended that the following items not be produced in main production chains: 

  * Aluminum Ingots
  * Modular Frame "family" (Heavy, Fused, Pressure Conversion Cube)
  * Oil Products (Plastic, Rubber, Fuel, Coke)



### Working with Liquids

In a production chain that involves the use of refineries or blenders, it is recommended that those production stages flow downwards, with the final product being at the bottom floor of the factory, and the input at the very top, to remove the use of fluid pumps. This way, it is only required to use pumps to transport liquid to the top floor. Additionally, the use of fluid buffers and valves is heavily discouraged. 

## Inputs, Outputs, and Logistics

### Raw Materials

Consider excluding raw material refinement (Eg. [Smelters](/wiki/Smelter "Smelter") or [Refineries](/wiki/Refinery "Refinery")) from production lines. Raw materials themselves have multiple methods of production including normal, alloy, and pure alternate recipes. Inserting an explicit type of raw material refinement into production lines can lock out better alternatives later in the game. 

Process the materials needed in a dedicated, nearby factory out of the way from potential expansion. This will allow old raw material processing factories to be rebuilt, and send along the same belts without impacting the rest of the production line. 

### Load Balancing vs Manifold

[Load Balancing](/wiki/Balancer "Balancer") is the process of delivering exactly the number of items/min to the destination, eg splitting a Mk1 belt 3 ways will deliver 20 items/min/belt, merge 2 for 40/min, and so on. 

[Manifold](/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") is using [Conveyor Splitters](/wiki/Conveyor_Splitter "Conveyor Splitter") and [Smart Splitters](/wiki/Smart_Splitter "Smart Splitter") to send resources to a destination, and letting split-off lines backlog to supply additional resources further up. 

Arguments can be made for either system, however here is a general breakdown of pros and cons: 

#### **Balancing**

  * Production can be run at 100% of the time. With each production stage receiving equal resources all the machinery can run at an equal capacity.
  * Balancing can be complicated to get specific values, as well as space consuming.
  * Minimal backlogging of resources, all items are consumed as soon as they are ready.



_There are very few uses of load balancing, avoid if possible._

#### **Manifold**

  * Extremely compact
  * First in - first served can cause factories to have a 'boot time' (especially with high-stack items, like [Wire](/wiki/Wire "Wire"))
  * First in - first served can improve resource utilization (3 [Constructors](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor") with 1 item vs 1 [Constructor](/wiki/Constructor "Constructor") with 3 items and 2 empty)
  * Using [Smart Splitter](/wiki/Smart_Splitter "Smart Splitter") Overflow can cause a large time invested into configuring Overflow and Any parameters (normal [Splitters](/wiki/Conveyor_Splitter "Conveyor Splitter") are advised)



When designing, a combination of these can be most effective. For example, use a [manifold](/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") on the main belt, splitting off into [balancers](/wiki/Balancer "Balancer"), and resupply the main belt utilizing [belt compressors](/wiki/Balancer "Balancer") from other adjacent belts. 

  
Generally, it is suggested that load balancers are only used to split items at quantities of 60/min and lower: these are usually end-game items such as nuclear rods, pressure conversion cubes, radio control units, etc., where filling it up via manifold would take a large amount of time. 

#### Output Merger Balancing

When merging outputs from a large number of sources, avoid filling a belt to full from a single line of [Conveyor Mergers](/wiki/Conveyor_Merger "Conveyor Merger"). [Mergers](/wiki/Conveyor_Merger "Conveyor Merger") take equally from each input, meaning a item output at the end of a [Merger](/wiki/Conveyor_Merger "Conveyor Merger") belt will supply 1:1, while the next will supply 1:2, the next 1:4, etc. When output items are constructed in large sets (Eg 13 [Pure Iron Ingots](/wiki/Iron_Ingot "Iron Ingot") at once) this can cause issues with backlogging other outputs. Instead make 2 or more belts that merge together throughout the process before joining to a single output line.
