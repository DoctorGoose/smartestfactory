# Creatures

On the Planet called MASSAGE-2(A-B)b in the binary star system of Akycha there are many creatures (fauna), both benign and hostile, that will be seen by the [Pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer"). 

While some creatures will be seen regardless of time of day, others will only appear at night between dusk and dawn. Additionally some creatures will appear everywhere on the [Map](/wiki/Map "Map"), sometimes in biome-specific "variants", while others will only appear in [Caves](/wiki/Cave "Cave").

## Spawning

Creatures are associated with spawn points on the map, and (with the exception of tamed [](/wiki/Lizard_Doggo "Lizard Doggo") [Lizard Doggos](/wiki/Lizard_Doggo "Lizard Doggo")) are not persistent; they are spawned only when the Pioneer comes into range of their personal spawn point. Spawn points may become inactive for several reasons (see #Respawning below). 

Creature spawn points have limits set on how many of a specific type of creature will spawn _in that location_. There can be multiple spawn points in close proximity to one another, each belonging to a different creature.[1]

There is a set limit to the amount of AI creatures that are allowed to be active at anyone time map-wide in order to maintain game performance.[2] Having for example multiple [tamed Lizard Doggos](/wiki/Lizard_Doggo#Taming "Lizard Doggo") can affect how many _other creatures_ the pioneer will see while exploring.

## Respawning

_Main article:_[ Combat > Creature respawn mechanism](/wiki/Combat#Creature_respawn_mechanism "Combat")

[](/wiki/File:Information.png) | _Information in this section is based on behavior observed in-game. Citations may be needed._  
---|---  
  
Creatures will despawn once the Pioneer gets far enough away from the creature and its spawn point. The current location and health of a creature is not saved when it despawns; the creature will appear again with full health at its spawn point the next time the Pioneer approaches that spawn point. 

When a creature is killed, its spawn point will become inactive for three in-game days, and the creature will no longer spawn during that time. However, spawn points of dead creatures will not reactivate if the area has been sufficiently built in by the player; see [Combat#Creature_respawn_mechanism](/wiki/Combat#Creature_respawn_mechanism "Combat") for full details. 

Creatures that fall into the [Void](/wiki/Void "Void") are not considered killed. They will respawn almost immediately if the player is still within range of their spawn point. 

## Infighting

[](/wiki/File:Information.png) | _Information in this section is based on behavior observed in-game. Citations may be needed._  
---|---  
  
Certain types of hostile creatures will fight others on sight. This information can be useful to an adventuring pioneer, who may be able to lead a powerful enemy into conflict with another powerful enemy to kill one and weaken the other. Creatures that are attacked by another creature may attempt to retaliate against a direct attacker (but will flee from indirect attacks, such as [Poison Gas](/wiki/Poison_Gas "Poison Gas")).
