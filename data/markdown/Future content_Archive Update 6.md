## Ammunition types

As part of the equipment changes in the update, there will be different ammunition types for the three weapons [Rebar Gun](/wiki/Rebar_Gun "Rebar Gun"), [Rifle](/wiki/Rifle "Rifle") and [Nobelisks](/wiki/Nobelisk_Detonator#Nobelisk "Nobelisk Detonator"). You can change the ammunition type of your weapon with holding "R" and selecting the type in the wheel. 

For the Rebar Gun there will be three additional ammunition types: 

  * Iron Rebar, the rebar that is currently in the game. Nothing is different about the mechanics of this rebar but it has a new stack size with 100 items per stack.[U6 28]
  * Stun Rebar, this rebar deals a less damage and stuns the enemy for five seconds. The stack size of this rebar is 100 items.[U6 29]
  * Shatter Rebar, this rebar breaks in to many smaller rebars directly after being shot, like a shotgun. The damage of this rebar has no distance decay, like normal game shotguns, and the stack size is 100 items.[U6 30]
  * Explosive Rebar, this rebar creates a big explosion on collision and deals a bit more damage than the regular rebar. The stack size of this rebar is 100 items.[U6 31]



For the Rifle there will be two additional ammunition types: 

  * Rifle Ammo, this is the ammo that is already in the game with changes to the magazine size from 10 to 15 and stack size from 100 to 500.[U6 32]
  * Turbo Ammo, this ammo lets you turn your rifle in a machine gun. As you keep shooting your accuracy will decay and your firerate will increase. The magazine size of this ammo is 75 and the stack size is 500.[U6 33]
  * Homing Ammo, this ammo tracks enemies in that are in tracking range as you shoot. The magazine size of this ammo is 15 and the stack size is 100.[U6 34]



There will be four new types of Nobelisks: 

  * Nobelisk, this is the noblelisk that is already in game and it won't get any changes.[U6 35]
  * Pulse Nobelisk, this nobelisk doesn't deal damage, but it creates a big pulse/shockwave that pushes enemies away. The stack size of this nobelisk is 50.[U6 36]
  * Cluster Nobelisk, this nobelisk creates a cluster of explosions when it's explodes, this could be useful for map clearance. The stack size of this nobelisk is 50.[U6 37]
  * Nuke Nobelisk, this nobelisk creates a huge and deadly explosion. The stack size of this nobelisk is 50.[U6 38][U6 39]
  * Gas Nobelisk, this nobelisk will create a gas cloud for which every enemy will try to flee. The stack size is unknown but probably also 50.[U6 40]



## Creature changes

As part of the creature changes the creature AI and looks will be reworked.[U6 41]

  * Creatures will now react to sounds, meaning if the pioneer is too loud the creature will detect them.



With Update 6 there will be some changes made to most of the creatures. 

For the Spitters, there will be 3 biome dependent variants rather than the 2 colours we have in Update 5. The new variants will eventually have unique abilities but in Update 6 they will all have the same behaviour.[U6 42]

  * The desert variant, this variant will have a red colour similar to the rocks in the dune desert.
  * The tropical variant, this variant will be light blue and have strings of seaweed hanging from its body.
  * The forest variant, this variant will feature a green and gray camouflage and have roots hanging from its head.



The Fluffy Tailed Hogs will have slight behaviour changes.[U6 43]

  * The Hogs will now show when they are about to charge into the pioneer a bit more clearly.
  * The Hogs will be somewhat better at chasing the pioneer in combat.



The Flying Crab Hatcher will have a rework. [U6 44]

  * The Flying Crab Hatcher will get a reskin.
  * The Flying Crab Hatcher will keep spawning Flying Crabs until the hatcher is destroyed by the pioneer.
  * Flying Crabs will now only have one HP, meaning they will be killed in one hit no matter what weapon is used.
  * The Flying Crab AI has been simplified to only have the crabs fly directly towards the player.



There will be a new creature in Update 6 Although it hasn't been shown yet. 

## New Parts

There will be a couple of new parts introduced into the game to help the progression. [U6 45]

  * 4 different types of alien remains, drops from creatures in the game will now have to be ground down into Alien Protein to be usable.
  * DNA Capsules, will be made out of Alien Protein and will be used in research and some additional unspecified purposes.
  * Smokeless Powder, made out of Black Powder and Heavy Oil Residue, will presumably be used in the new ammo crafting recipes.



## MAM

_Main article:_[MAM](/wiki/MAM "MAM")

Some items in the MAM have been moved around for balancing. The MAM has been made more accessible as well. [U6 46]

  * Blade runners will be moved to the Quartz research tree.
  * The Polyester Fabric alternative recipe will now be unlocked in the Mycelia research tree, requiring 25 Fabric and 100 Polymer Resin to unlock.
  * Compacted Coal will now be unlocked in the Sulfur research tree, requiring 25 Sulfur, 25 Coal and 1 Hard Drive to unlock.
  * Turbofuel will now be unlocked in the Sulfur research tree, requiring 50 Packaged Fuel, 15 Compacted Coal and 1 Hard Drive to unlock.
  * Future research will be less hidden, this means that you will be able to look further ahead when researching a node.
  * Any MAM research node that unlocks items in the AWESOME Shop will now show this when hovering over the node.



## AWESOME Shop

_Main article:_[AWESOME Shop](/wiki/AWESOME_Shop "AWESOME Shop")

Purchases that require more research will no longer be hidden but rather show the research requirements [U6 47]
