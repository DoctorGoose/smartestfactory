## Intro

**Hi Pioneers!**

Today it’s the release of our first content update since leaving early access and we would like to introduce you all to our newest features with our 1.1 update! 

This update is available right now on the Experimental version of the game, so before trying it out it’s always good to **BACKUP YOUR SAVES**

This is how you can access the Experimental version: 

  * Steam: Right clicking the game > Properties > Betas > Beta Participation > Experimental
  * Epic: Go to your library and download the Experimental version



  
**Why Experimental?**

Since the 1.0 release, we want to continue delivering a stable experience on the default version of the game 

Using experimental allows us to polish everything up some more before releasing it to everyone and potentially including some side effects which might affect the current experience 

Also, as usual this update is quite big in terms of changes as we’ve been working alongside with Fishlabs (<https://fishlabs.de/>) for a few years now 

They have designed and implemented the controller support in preparation for the Console release (Yes, Satisfactory is coming to consoles if you didn’t know already) with our blessing and collaboration 

This update includes many years worth of work so as usual, if you find anything unexpected or something that was working before suddenly does not work anymore, please let us know over at our QA Site <https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/>

## New features

### [Controller support](/wiki/Controls#Controller "Controls")

Controller support is now available in Satisfactory, with both Xbox and DualSense™ controllers supported. 

To use a controller, connect it to your dive and go into the Options menu > Controls > General > Select Controls > Controller > Apply 

### [Photo Mode](/wiki/Photo_Mode "Photo Mode")

The Photo Mode has got a major overhaul with brand new UI and Settings 

Including a multitude of new filters, effects, poses, frames, colour adjustments, camera lens controls to tweak to your liking, there’s a huge number of possibilities to get the ideal shot of you and your factories or you and your friends in multiplayer 

There’s also a dolly mode so you can create small transitions and videos or anything your creativity allows, as well as multiple grid and crop settings for aspect ratios 

You can also decouple the camera to move it around within a range of the pioneer and toggle visibility options for the Pioneer or even have the option to have the Pioneer’s helmet follow the camera around 

### [Crash site dismantling](/wiki/Crash_Site "Crash Site")

You will also now will finally be able to clean up debris from Crash Sites from your biomes and get some extra resources for your efforts by doing so 

Just remember that you must open and retrieve the [Hard Drive](/wiki/Hard_Drive "Hard Drive") inside the Crash Site first to be able to dismantle everything 

### [Personnel Elevator](/wiki/Personnel_Elevator "Personnel Elevator")

To expand your traversal options for Pioneers in larger factories, you can now build and use the new Personnel Elevator 

Once you do the initial elevator placement, you will be able to zoop vertically to desired your elevation and add as many Elevator Floor Stops as you wish to match with your factory design 

You will be able to customize the names for each floor as well as the icons and colours for each button that you can press to access each floor so you can keep track of exactly where each stop leads 

## [Advanced Game Settings](/wiki/Advanced_Game_Settings "Advanced Game Settings")

### No Fuel setting

The highly requested "No fuel" option has finally been added to Advanced Game Settings, so you if you enjoy playing with AGS, you no longer have to do extra steps when using vehicles 

## Trains

### [Buffer stops](/wiki/Buffer_Stop "Buffer Stop")

We're introducing a new mechanic for trains, when manually driving a [Train](/wiki/Train "Train") and reaching the end of the railway, Trains will now derail entirely and you will have to interact with the train in order to get it back on the rail, similar to how Train Collisions work 

To prevent this, you now must place Buffer Stops at the end of Railway paths, Including Train Stations, that you intend to manually drive through 

### Quality of Life

#### Left-handed Path and Block Signals

Both [Path Signals](/wiki/Path_Signal "Path Signal") and [Block Signals](/wiki/Block_Signal "Block Signal") now have a "Left Side" and "Right Side" build mode that can be alternated by pressing [`R`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") when having the hologram active 

#### Railways rework

[Railways](/wiki/Railway "Railway") have gotten some major improvements with their implementation, so they should be a lot nicer and better to build overall than ever 

## Buildings

### Logistics

#### [Conveyor Wall Hole](/wiki/Conveyor_Wall_Hole "Conveyor Wall Hole")

New Conveyor attachment that can be freely placed on any [Wall](/wiki/Walls "Walls") (and Windows!) allowing for conveyors to pass through to allow for more customization. 

A big improvement compared to the existing Conveyor walls with a fixed placement for connections 

#### Conveyor Lifts - Splitter and Merger support

The [Splitter](/wiki/Splitter "Splitter") and [Mergers](/wiki/Merger "Merger") capabilities have now improved, and they can now be attached to [Conveyor Lifts](/wiki/Conveyor_Lift "Conveyor Lift"), allowing more modularity to your vertical builds 

Splitters or Mergers will attach to both the Input or Output of a Conveyor Lift, as well to any point in-between, for extra flexibility in your builds 

#### [Priority Merger](/wiki/Priority_Merger "Priority Merger")

This is a new type of Merger that allows you to prioritize which one of its active inputs should be output first 

There are 3 levels of priority to choose, so if two inputs share the same level of priority, the output will alternate between taking from each input, allowing you to control the output of your factories much more carefully 

#### [Conveyor Throughput Monitor](/wiki/Conveyor_Throughput_Monitor "Conveyor Throughput Monitor")

A brand-new conveyor attachment that monitors the number of parts traveling through a conveyor belt and displays it on its screen, requires a full minute of gathering data to display the most accurate results 

You can now leave some of the calculations to this handy buildable and see at a glance if you’re producing your desired amount of parts on your factory 

### Quality of Life

#### [Pipeline Build Modes](/wiki/Pipelines "Pipelines")

##### Straight

After hearing the warm reception over the straight conveyor belt build mode, we have now added it for Pipes so you can finally create the perfectly organized setup without relying on manual placement 

##### Curved

Not only that, but we also included a Curved build mode for those times when you might need additional angles in your pipeline setup 

## Transport

### Hypertubes

#### [Hypertube Junctions](/wiki/Hypertube_Junction "Hypertube Junction")

Three-way hypertube junction that can be placed on its own, or attached to another hypertube junction or a [Hypertube Support](/wiki/Hypertube_Supports "Hypertube Supports")

Once placed, it allows you to connect a [Hypertube](/wiki/Hypertube "Hypertube") to its 3 different paths 

When traveling inside a hypertube, you can change paths by pressing [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") when approaching a junction to select which one of the routes you want to traverse through 

#### [Hypertube Branch](/wiki/Hypertube_Junction#Branch-0 "Hypertube Junction")

Can be placed in a Hypertube to split it into two separate paths, the resulting branching path can only be accessed by traveling through the longer segment due to its shape 

Useful for connecting existing hypertube networks to newly built ones 

It can be built on its own, on top of an existing hypertube or attached to a hypertube support or junction 

## Architecture

### New Architectural Pieces

There are new architectural pieces that you can build with the update to allow for more expression when designing your factories, all accessible from the [AWESOME Shop](/wiki/AWESOME_Shop "AWESOME Shop")

**[New Beams](/wiki/Beams "Beams"):**

  * H-Beam
  * Shelf Beam
  * Round Concrete Beam
  * Braided Cable (it's a beam)
  * Braided Cable Cluster (it's also a beam)



**New Misc.:**

  * [Roll-Up Gate](/wiki/Walls "Walls") (FICSIT, Concrete, Steel)
  * [Road Barrier Corner](/wiki/Walls#Other "Walls")
  * [Basic Shelf Unit](/wiki/Basic_Shelf_Unit "Basic Shelf Unit")
  * [Large Vent](/wiki/Large_Fan#Vent-0 "Large Fan")
  * [Large Fan](/wiki/Large_Fan "Large Fan")



## Quality of Life

### Automatic connections of Conveyor, Pipes and Railways in Blueprints

There is now a new “Auto Connect” build mode for [Blueprints](/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint") that you can select by pressing [`R`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") when having a Blueprint Hologram out 

When using this mode, any blueprint that contains [Conveyor Belts](/wiki/Conveyor_Belts "Conveyor Belts"), [Pipelines](/wiki/Pipelines "Pipelines") and [Railways](/wiki/Railway "Railway") will try to automatically connect to any available inputs/outputs on the other end, which you can visually confirm before placing by hovering over with the blueprint hologram 

### [Flashlight](/wiki/Flashlight "Flashlight") now works while inside Hypertubes

Long requested QOL for traveling inside [Hypertubes](/wiki/Hypertube "Hypertube") during nighttime with improved visibility 

### [Drone](/wiki/Drone "Drone") movement and pathing improvements

Many improvements to drone movement and pathing which should improve the way drones interact with their automated routes 

### [Conveyor Poles](/wiki/Conveyor_Poles "Conveyor Poles") and [Pipeline Supports](/wiki/Pipeline_Supports "Pipeline Supports") now have soft clearance

This will help adjust the placement even more in limited spaces as they can now overlap with other buildables 

### [Nudging](/wiki/Build_Gun#Hologram_lock_and_nudge_mode "Build Gun") can now be done vertically as well

Major request since the introduction of nudging, you can now Nudge vertically with [`Page up`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") and [`Page down`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")

### Removed max distance limit on Nudging

You can freely really refine the placement of all your buildings without having to rely on precise aiming since we have now removed the distance limit on nudging 

## Visual Improvments

### Falling Trees

Expanding to the polish of our [foliage](/wiki/Flora "Flora"), Trees will now gracefully fall after being cut by the [Chainsaw](/wiki/Chainsaw "Chainsaw") with all new effects 

### [Spore](/wiki/Spore_Flower "Spore Flower") & [Gas Pillar](/wiki/Gas_Pillar "Gas Pillar") VFX

Spore and Gas Pillar visual effects have gotten an overhaul to improve their look 

### [Explosive Rebar](/wiki/Explosive_Rebar "Explosive Rebar") and [Nobelisk](/wiki/Nobelisk "Nobelisk")VFX

Continuing with our polish, the explosion effects created by the [Explosive Rebar](/wiki/Explosive_Rebar "Explosive Rebar") and the [Nobelisk](/wiki/Nobelisk "Nobelisk") have received a new improved look as well 

### [Power Slug](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug") VFX

Also received some polish so you can marvel at as you pick them up before you unavoidably turn them into power shards 

## [Audio Improvements](/wiki/Unreal_Engine#Game_audio "Unreal Engine")

### Dynamic occlusion system for foundations and walls

Factory sounds will now be occluded and muffled if they are behind walls or other obstacles. Different buildings will also change the way the sounds occlude, for example, glass or metal. 

### Audio indoor detection system and local acoustic context

Factory and player sounds will now behave differently if the player is indoors, [The HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB") now has a unique audio setup as well 

Player related sounds will now change dynamically depending on your surroundings for example high ceilings, tight corridors or inside caves. 

### Voice Chat Attenuation

Now has different strength levels adjustable in [Settings](/wiki/Settings "Settings")

Attenuation now uses mid-side stereo positioning rather than just ducking specific frequencies 

## [Narrative](/wiki/Story "Story")

We have now also expanded on the narrative from 1.0 with the inclusion of many, many more ADA voice lines for new and old content and interactions 

## Bug Fixes

There are many bugfixes that we could not properly do during 1.0 as well as improvements that are currently being tested in experimental, which will carry over to 1.1 

For more info on the changes that will carry over from current Experimental please check the links below: 

  * [Patch 1.0.1.5](/wiki/Patch_1.0.1.5 "Patch 1.0.1.5")
  * [Patch 1.0.1.6](/wiki/Patch_1.0.1.6 "Patch 1.0.1.6")



## [Dedicated Servers](/wiki/Dedicated_Servers "Dedicated Servers") \- Port Forwarding Updates

If you Host a dedicated server, you should read the next block as many new improvements have been added to allow for extra flexibility since the last update on Experimental 

We have updated the Port Allocation Strategy in Reliable Messaging 

New features: 

### Explicit Port Configuration

  * A new `-ReliablePort=` command-line parameter allows explicit port selection.
  * The value must be an integer between 0 and 65535.
  * If specified, the server will attempt to bind to this port and fail to initialize if the port is unavailable.



### Default and Configurable Port Ranges

The following settings in Engine.ini control port allocation: 
    
    
    [/Script/ReliableMessaging.ReliableMessagingTCPFactory]
    PortRangeBegin=8888
    PortRangeLength=512
    ExternalPortRangeBegin=-1
    

  * The server will attempt to bind within [PortRangeBegin, PortRangeBegin + PortRangeLength).
  * By default, the server starts at port 8888 and tries up to 512 ports until it finds an available one.



### Client Awareness & NAT Handling

  * Clients must connect to the correct port, but port remapping (e.g., via NAT/firewall rules) can break this.
  * To address this, the server now communicates the listening port to clients during the initial handshake.
  * If external port remapping is used, the server must be aware of the external port via: 
    * The ExternalPortRangeBegin config setting (for remapped ranges).
    * The `-ExternalReliablePort=` command-line parameter (for explicitly mapped ports).



### Server Host Requirements (TL;DR)

  * If hosting a single server, port 8888 TCP must be open by default.
  * If hosting multiple servers, a range of ports starting from 8888 TCP (by default) must be open.
  * The server will attempt up to 512 ports before failing (configurable).
  * If port remapping (NAT/firewall) is used, the server must be configured accordingly; otherwise, clients won’t be able to connect.
  * Logging is in place to help server maintainers verify the allocated ports.
