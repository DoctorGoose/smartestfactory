# Jetpack

## Jetpack

[ ](/wiki/File:Jetpack.png "Jetpack.png")

_Allows pioneers to travel through the air with increased control.  
Fuel is automatically consumed from the pioneer's inventory to refill the Jetpack while on the ground.  
Different fuel types can be used and provide different levels of Jetpack efficiency. The preferred fuel type will be used if available, and can be set in the equipment inventory._

### Creature loot

A [Jetpack Hog](/wiki/Jetpack_Hog "Jetpack Hog") drops a single Jetpack on death. As one can spawn at any stage in the game, it allows a Jetpack to be obtained before [Tier 5](/wiki/Tier_6 "Tier 6") and used as soon as in [Tier 2](/wiki/Tier_2 "Tier 2"), when [](/wiki/Solid_Biofuel "Solid Biofuel") [Solid Biofuel](/wiki/Solid_Biofuel "Solid Biofuel") becomes available. (Alternatively, [](/wiki/Packaged_Liquid_Biofuel "Packaged Liquid Biofuel") [Packaged Liquid Biofuel](/wiki/Packaged_Liquid_Biofuel "Packaged Liquid Biofuel") can be found at [Crash Sites](/wiki/Crash_Site "Crash Site") at any point in the game, but only in small amounts.) 

## Usage

### Equipment

[](/wiki/File:Jetpack_Preferred_Fuel_-_Inventory.png)

[](/wiki/File:Jetpack_Preferred_Fuel_-_Inventory.png "Enlarge")

A Jetpack equipped in the back slot in the [Inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory")

The Jetpack is a personal flight device that is equipped. It is used to increase altitude and potentially avoid fall damage. It also increases mobility during jumps, making the directional keys move the player faster than they would normally. 

### Controls

You hold down [`Space`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (Jump) key to burn Jetpack Fuel to increase in altitude. You release [`Space`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (Jump) key to descend. 

To prevent fall damage, simply tap [`Space`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (Jump) just before the pioneer reaches the ground. This will consume a small amount of fuel. 

When flying horizontally, it is advised to tap [`Space`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (Jump) once in a while at the correct timing, instead of simply holding down the [`Space`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (Jump) key. This will allows the pioneer to perform a series of smaller jumps in the air, which greatly increases the flight range. 

The (especially horizontal) speed of the pioneer in the air is based on the speed the pioneer had while taking off, so, if the pioneer was running on a [Mk.6 Conveyor Belt](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt "Conveyor Belt") before taking off, the flight speed would be greatly increased. This can also be taken to the extreme using a [Hypertube cannon](/wiki/Hypertube_cannon "Hypertube cannon") to traverse the entire map if built correctly. 

### Fuel

[](/wiki/File:Jetpack_Preferred_Fuel_-_UI.png)

[](/wiki/File:Jetpack_Preferred_Fuel_-_UI.png "Enlarge")

Preferred Fuel Type UI

[](/wiki/File:Jetpack_Fuel_Heights_1.0.png)

[](/wiki/File:Jetpack_Fuel_Heights_1.0.png "Enlarge")

The height that can be reached with each fuel type (no tapping)

The Jetpack requires fuel in the pioneer's inventory to operate. A fuel bar is displayed at the lower left of the HUD. It quickly depletes during the flight. Refueling happens automatically when the pioneer is standing on a solid surface (not in the air), swimming, climbing a [Ladder](/wiki/Ladder "Ladder"), or while [ziplining](/wiki/Zipline "Zipline"), consuming the selected fuel from the inventory. 

The Jetpack can use any of the fuels listed below. In the Inventory [`Tab ↹`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), a preferred fuel type can be set by clicking the gear icon ⚙️ while the Jetpack is equipped in the back slot. 

The preferred fuel will be used first if available. Otherwise, any other fuel in the order visible in the preferred fuel type UI is used.[1]

Each fuel type has different properties:[2]

Fuel | Burn time  | Flight Time * | Vertical speed | Height ** | Notes   
---|---|---|---|---|---  
[](/wiki/Solid_Biofuel "Solid Biofuel") [Solid Biofuel](/wiki/Solid_Biofuel "Solid Biofuel") | 2.8 s  | 12 s | 5 m/s | 14 m | Can be used prior to Tier 5.   
[](/wiki/Packaged_Fuel "Packaged Fuel") [Packaged Fuel](/wiki/Packaged_Fuel "Packaged Fuel") | 5 s  | 17 s  | 4.4 m/s | 22 m | Default fuel type.   
[](/wiki/Packaged_Turbofuel "Packaged Turbofuel") [Packaged Turbofuel](/wiki/Packaged_Turbofuel "Packaged Turbofuel") | 3.3 s  | 23 s | 14 m/s | 48 m | Provides improved air control.   
[](/wiki/Packaged_Liquid_Biofuel "Packaged Liquid Biofuel") [Packaged Liquid Biofuel](/wiki/Packaged_Liquid_Biofuel "Packaged Liquid Biofuel") | 12.5 s  | 53 s | 4.5 m/s | 56 m | Cannot be fully automated.   
[](/wiki/Packaged_Rocket_Fuel "Packaged Rocket Fuel") [Packaged Rocket Fuel](/wiki/Packaged_Rocket_Fuel "Packaged Rocket Fuel") | 4 s  | 27.5 s | 30 m/s | 120 m | Highest vertical velocity ceiling.   
[](/wiki/Packaged_Ionized_Fuel "Packaged Ionized Fuel") [Packaged Ionized Fuel](/wiki/Packaged_Ionized_Fuel "Packaged Ionized Fuel") | 7 s  | 60 s | 22.9 m/s | 160 m | Highest flight time of 60 seconds.   
  
* = Aiming for level flight with net 0 vertical acceleration, tapping the jump button 

** = Heights achieved holding down the jump button. 

  * [](/wiki/Solid_Biofuel "Solid Biofuel") [Solid Biofuel](/wiki/Solid_Biofuel "Solid Biofuel") is the only fuel available before Tier 5/6. It allows the Jetpack to be used earlier, such as when just getting started with Oil Processing, or when one is obtained from a [Jetpack Hog](/wiki/Jetpack_Hog "Jetpack Hog"). It is overall the worst fuel, having slow acceleration and the shortest burn time, and itself cannot be fully automated.
  * [](/wiki/Packaged_Fuel "Packaged Fuel") [Packaged Fuel](/wiki/Packaged_Fuel "Packaged Fuel") is the default fuel. It has an average acceleration and burn time, and can be automated easily. However, it is inferior to the following fuel types:
  * [](/wiki/Packaged_Turbofuel "Packaged Turbofuel") [Packaged Turbofuel](/wiki/Packaged_Turbofuel "Packaged Turbofuel") has faster acceleration and improved air mobility, which makes it ideal to use during [combat](/wiki/Combat "Combat"), especially against [Cliff Hogs](/wiki/Cliff_Hog "Cliff Hog") and [Elite Stingers](/wiki/Stinger "Stinger"). It takes some additional resources to be automated, but the gains make it worthwhile.
  * [](/wiki/Packaged_Liquid_Biofuel "Packaged Liquid Biofuel") [Packaged Liquid Biofuel](/wiki/Packaged_Liquid_Biofuel "Packaged Liquid Biofuel") has the same acceleration as Packaged Fuel, but lasts much longer, allowing it to traverse greater distances and go higher than even Packaged Turbofuel. This makes it an ideal all-round and exploration fuel. Its only downside is that it cannot be fully automated, much like Solid Biofuel.
  * [](/wiki/Packaged_Rocket_Fuel "Packaged Rocket Fuel") [Packaged Rocket Fuel](/wiki/Packaged_Rocket_Fuel "Packaged Rocket Fuel") has the extreme acceleration and maneuverability, and a relatively low burn time. The powerful vertical thrust makes it ideal for scaling cliffs and combat. The short burn time makes it less efficient than Packaged Liquid Biofuel for distance traversal. The combination of powerful vertical thrust and shorter burn time can be dangerous when used carelessly.
  * [](/wiki/Packaged_Ionized_Fuel "Packaged Ionized Fuel") [Packaged Ionized Fuel](/wiki/Packaged_Ionized_Fuel "Packaged Ionized Fuel") has the second highest acceleration and the second highest burn time, but has the best combined performance of any fuel in the game. It can maintain vertical flight the longest allowing for long distance traversal and it can also climb the highest as well. It is the ideal fuel for all circumstances. It requires Power Shards to create making it impractical to produce until very late in the game.

### AWESOME Sink

**[](/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack")Jetpack** can be sunk into the [](/wiki/AWESOME_Sink "AWESOME Sink") [AWESOME Sink](/wiki/AWESOME_Sink "AWESOME Sink") to yield **16,580 points**.

## Current issues

  * During autosave, the Jetpack will continue adding upward velocity during the short freeze that sometimes occurs, causing a sudden upward boost when the game unfreezes that can greatly exceed the Jetpack's normal abilities for increasing altitude.
  * Activating the jetpack while using the [Photo Mode Decoupled Camera](/wiki/Photo_Mode#Enable_Decoupled_Camera "Photo Mode") causes the character to continuously ascend, with the jetpack's flame effect persisting even after fuel is depleted. This allows for indefinite upward movement, albeit without any maneuverability. Upon returning to normal gameplay (exiting camera mode), the character will immediately begin to fall if the jetpack's fuel has been exhausted.



## Tips

  * For routinely crossing large distances, it is best combined with a [Hyper Tube cannon](/wiki/Tutorial:Hypertube_cannon "Tutorial:Hypertube cannon").
  * In mid-air you can throw and detonate [Pulse Nobelisks](/wiki/Nobelisk_Detonator "Nobelisk Detonator") behind you to greatly increase your speed
  * The [Tilted Jump Pad](/wiki/Tilted_Jump_Pad "Tilted Jump Pad") also boosts the flight range of the Jetpack.
  * The Jetpack is complementary to the [Hoverpack](/wiki/Hoverpack "Hoverpack"), which can be used in [powered](/wiki/Power "Power") areas.
  * Bring a [Parachute](/wiki/Parachute "Parachute"). If you run out of fuel you can switch to it mid-air and deploy it for a safe landing.
  * Opening the construction window while holding down the jump button will give players a sudden vertical boost. By repeatedly triggering this smoothly, over double the normal height can be gained.
  * A similar effect to the previous trick can be achieved by opening the inventory, however it gives less height than the construction window method.
  * Rapidly pressing the jump button, but not spamming outright, can double height gained, but is fairly inconsistent.
