The in-game [map](/wiki/Map "Map")

_Satisfactory_ takes place on a single **world** (or "**[map](/wiki/Map "Map")** "). The map is hand-crafted and features no procedural generation.[1] The World size is 47.1 km2 (or 7.972 km x 6.8 km). 

_Coordinate range (x, y)_ is between -3246, -3750 (North West) and 4253, 3750 (South East) The diagonal distance between these two points is 10.6 km (10605.9m). 

There are multiple biomes present in the world including deserts, forests, lakes, grass fields, mountains and [caves](/wiki/Cave "Cave"). The vast majority of the landscape cannot be deformed or changed in any way, but there are some structures such as [cracked boulders](/wiki/Cracked_boulder "Cracked boulder") which can be destroyed by [explosives](/wiki/Explosive "Explosive"). There is a Day/Night cycle, and the fog thickness can change throughout the day. Although some machines visually emit smoke or smog, there is no concept of pollution.[2] The world also contains [creatures](/wiki/Category:Fauna "Category:Fauna") for the [pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer") to encounter, several of which are [hostile](/wiki/Combat "Combat"). 

The playable world (in-game referred to as "your [FICSIT](/wiki/FICSIT_Inc. "FICSIT Inc.") designated sector") is a part of a planet called MASSAGE-2(A-B)b in the binary star system of Akycha.

## Biomes

### Starting areas

The player can choose one of four locations to start in: the Grass Fields, Rocky Desert, Northern Forest or Dune Desert. 

#### Grass Fields

**Ideal for first-time pioneers**  
The first viable building location FICSIT had found, standing out because of its open and relatively flat fields. Considering the distances between mining locations, building outposts and/or large transportation lines may be necessary eventually. 

  * Terrain flatness:★★★★★
  * Biomass: ★★★☆☆
  * Resource amount: ★★★☆☆
  * Resource diversity: ★★★☆☆



[](/wiki/File:Grass_Fields_Area.png)

#### Rocky Desert

**Suitable for first-time pioneers**  
The textbook example of a FICSIT-approved building location, with balanced resources, space, and distances. Additionally, it is very close to the sea, making water an easy commodity. 

  * Terrain flatness:★★★★☆
  * Biomass: ★★★☆☆
  * Resource amount: ★★★☆☆
  * Resource diversity: ★★★★☆



[](/wiki/File:Rocky_Desert_Area.png)

#### Northern Forest

**Good for more experienced pioneers**  
A lush building location with many height differences and a few open areas, challenging conventional building and planning methods. Despite these challenges, it caught our eye due to the richness of its resources. 

  * Terrain flatness:★☆☆☆☆
  * Biomass: ★★★★★
  * Resource amount: ★★★★☆
  * Resource diversity: ★★★★★



[](/wiki/File:Northern_Forest.png)

#### Dune Desert

**Recommended for advanced pioneers**  
Initially considered too risky, further investigation has convinced us that this area is viable for building with its large, open spaces and plentiful mining locations. Foliage and water locations are rare and contained, making initial power set-ups challenging. 

  * Terrain flatness:★★★★☆
  * Biomass: ★★☆☆☆
  * Resource amount: ★★★★★
  * Resource diversity: ★★☆☆☆

### Biome list

[](/wiki/File:Biome_Map.jpg)

[](/wiki/File:Biome_Map.jpg "Enlarge")

Biome Map (Version 1.0)

According to the [Map](/wiki/Map "Map") that appeared in one of the Developer's Highlights and other resources,[3][4] there are 21 named biomes, 4 of which are the starting areas, highlighted in **Bold** : 

Biomes  Name | Grid | Description | [Biomass](/wiki/Biomass "Biomass") amount | Terrain difficulty | [Hostility](/wiki/Combat "Combat")  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Abyss Cliffs | X5Y1  | Small mountainous area with lots of stone bridges with numerous buttes at different heights.  
[](/wiki/File:Abyss_Cliffs.png) | very low | very high | low  
Blue Crater | 4XY0-Y1  | Sunken area filled with many large multi-layered fungus, with lots of cavities formed in-between. [Mycelia](/wiki/Mycelia "Mycelia") and [Bacon Agaric](/wiki/Bacon_Agaric "Bacon Agaric") are common on the ground.  
[](/wiki/File:Blue_Crater.png) | moderate | high | high  
Crater Lakes | X2Y3  | A highland with multiple craters that leads to Red Bamboo Fields.  
[](/wiki/File:Crater_Lakes.png) | moderate | medium | medium

[](/wiki/File:Desert_Canyons.png) | low | medium | medium  
**Dune Desert** | X5Y3-X6Y5  | One of the Starting Areas. Huge open desert featuring large sand dunes and rocky terrain. Grouped biomass only available in the tree oases makes early game considerably more challenging. Numerous rocks on the ground mark the entrance to various caves.  
[](/wiki/File:Dune_Desert_Area.png) | low | low | low  
Eastern Dune Forest | X3Y1-X4Y1  | Sandy forest located at the East of the world. Patches of sand dunes are separated by thin grassy areas.  
[](/wiki/File:Eastern_Dune_Forest.png) | moderate | low | low  
**Grass Fields** | X2Y0  | One of the Starting Areas. Large open grassy area, often with impure nodes. Stone arches are the landmarks in the area. [Hogs](/wiki/Hog "Hog") are common.  
[](/wiki/File:Grass_Fields_Area.png) | moderate | very low | low  
Jungle Spires | X1Y1  | Area cut through with ravines, contains trees and arc-shaped stones. Contains the tallest cave in the world.

[](/wiki/File:Lake_Forest.png) | moderate | medium | medium  
Maze Canyons | X4Y3  | A rocky area with many stone bridges crisscrossed at different heights, resembles a 3D maze. Poison pillars can be found on most of the high grounds. It is one of the good spot for setting up Coal Power. Be wary of the night-spawn creatures.  
[](/wiki/File:Maze_Canyons.png) | low | high | low  
**Northern Forest** | X2Y4-X4Y3  | One of the Starting Areas. Grassy area with hills and moderate amount of biomass. The uneven ground makes base building in the early-game difficult without Foundations.  
[](/wiki/File:Northern_Forest.png) | high | medium | low  
Red Bamboo Fields | X2Y2-X3Y2  | Highland with red foliage, consisting of a dense bamboo forest and a numbers of tall, indestructible trees and flower plants. Filled with [Spitters](/wiki/Spitter "Spitter"), [Stingers](/wiki/Stinger "Stinger") and [Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug").  
[](/wiki/File:Red_Bamboo_Fields.png) | very high | high | very high  
Red Jungle | X1Y2-X2Y2  | Highland with red foliage, has large trees mixed with red foliage and stone arches. Lots of dangerous hostile creatures can be found. Features large open sided caves.  
[](/wiki/File:Red_Jungle.png) | very high | very high | very high  
**Rocky Desert** | X0Y3-X1Y4  | One of the Starting Areas. Open desert area rich with Resource Nodes. Contains the world's highest point and longest cave.  
[](/wiki/File:Rocky_Desert_Area.png) | moderate | medium | medium  
Snaketree Forest | X2Y1  | Small, hilly forest with small trees beside the Grass Fields.  
[](/wiki/File:Snaketree_Forest.png) | moderate | moderate | low  
Southern Forest | X3Y0-Y1  | Dense forest with blue foliage. Populated by Stingers, especially at night.  
[](/wiki/File:Southern_Forest.png) | high | high | medium  
Spire Coast | X3Y4-X5Y5  | A coast full of plants and waterfalls, with tall mesa bordering the Dune Desert and Desert Canyon. There are many multi-layered caves within the mesa mountains.  
[](/wiki/File:Spire_Coast.png) | moderate | high | low  
Swamp | X5Y2  | Area with lots of water and trees. [Poison Gas](/wiki/Poison_Gas "Poison Gas"), Elite Stingers and Alpha Spitters are common. Features several large caves.  
[](/wiki/File:Swamp.png) | moderate | very high | very high  
Titan Forest | X3Y2-X5Y3  | Forest on a moderately high ground with humongous indestructible trees, leaving only moderate amount of harvestable biomass. There are a few large caves hidden below it.  
[](/wiki/File:Titan_Forest.png) | moderate | very high | very high  
Western Beaches | X0Y1-Y2  | A set of islands located at the western beach, with the foliage of Grass Fields. Contains many [Oil](/wiki/Oil "Oil") [Nodes](/wiki/Resource_Node "Resource Node"). Previously called 'Islands'.  
[](/wiki/File:Western_Beaches.png) | low | low | medium  
Western Dune Forest | X1Y2-X2Y1  | Sandy forest located at the West of the world, with lakes and a small waterfall. One of the good spot for setting up Coal Power, but it can be hostile during the night.  
[](/wiki/File:Western_Dune_Forest.png) | moderate | medium | low  
  
Grid size is exactly 1.024 x 1.024 km (128 x 128 foundations). Grid numbering starts with X:0, Y:0 from the south-west corner. Refers to [Media:Biome_Map.jpg](/images/Biome_Map.jpg?5a7a1a&format=original "Biome Map.jpg")

There used to be two separate biomes that have become parts of other biomes: Savanna → Rocky Desert and No Man's Land → Grass Fields.[4]

In [Version 1.0](/wiki/Patch_1.0#World "Patch 1.0") the world border was moved to allow full access to Paradise Island in the southwest corner of the [Map](/wiki/Map "Map"). 

## Environmental features

### Day and night cycle

Game simulates a day and night cycle that consists of the transition of two stars from horizon to horizon. There is no "moon" that orbits Massage-2(A-B)b,[5] but what is commonly thought of as a moon is in reality a bluish-white dwarf star. 

One day on Massage-2(A-B)b lasts for 60 real-world minutes, the "daytime" is 45 minutes long and the "nighttime" is 15 minutes long with 30 seconds of complete darkness during each transition, due to both stars being below the horizon. Both stars (Massage-2A, a yellow main sequence star and Massage-2B, a bluish-white dwarf) rise roughly in the North-West and set in the South-East. There are also several other planets that can be seen hovering in the sky. 

As the stars move, the shadows based on light angle will move in steps, _(this is normal)_. During the day cycle the shadow movement will be smaller, while during the night cycle the shadow movement will be bigger. The shadow of the [Space Elevator](/wiki/Space_Elevator "Space Elevator") sweeps around the world, no matter how far the land is from the Space Elevator. Note: On low graphics settings, the light angle can suddenly jump to the other side of the sky. This is probably a bug. 

### Atmosphere and weather

Every biome has its own lighting and ambience sound effects. 

In Update 6[6] and 7, there used to be occasional rainfall across the world, excluding the Dune Desert. It has been removed in Update 8[7] due to the upgrade to [Unreal Engine 5](/wiki/Unreal_Engine "Unreal Engine"), and might return in a Post-Version 1.0 update.[8]

When it rained, buildings and vehicles would become wet, giving them a glossy appearance. Apart from this visual effect, weather did not have any impact on gameplay. 

### Caves

_Main article:_[Cave](/wiki/Cave "Cave")

The _Satisfactory_ world is filled with more than 52 caves. The 5 largest and most important caves are listed below. Stingers are common and appear in nearly every cave. 

Name  | Contents  | Entrances   
---|---|---  
Grass Fields Uranium cave  | A long cave with lots of curves and height differences. Contains one of the four [Uranium](/wiki/Uranium "Uranium") nodes.  | 2   
Swamp Waterfall cave  | An open cave located behind the large waterfall in the Swamp. Contains one of the four [Uranium](/wiki/Uranium "Uranium") nodes and it is guarded by several strong creatures.  | 2   
Rocky Desert cave  | A large cave in the Rocky Desert with multiple entrances. Has three [Quartz](/wiki/Quartz "Quartz") and one [SAM](/wiki/SAM "SAM") node inside.  | 5   
Lizard Doggo cave  | A large cave in the Dangle Spires. Contains a few [Lizard Doggos](/wiki/Lizard_Doggo "Lizard Doggo"), and a lot of loot-able items on the ground, scattered at different elevations. Has large internal area and is very tall.  | 3+   
Tunnel  | A short but open cave linking the Western Dune Forest and the Rocky Desert.  | 3   
  
### Void

  * The void refers to any area that is not covered by natural terrain beneath.
  * If the pioneer reaches the bottom surface of the void, i.e. by falling into it, their health will start to decrease at 5HP/sec, and, after reaching a certain Z-value, dying instantly.
  * The world is surrounded by a combination of the water body and the void.
  * There are several void openings in the world.
  * The bottom surface of the entire world consists of the void. It can be observed if the pioneer happens to 'clip' through the terrain or by navigating below the world through the edges.
  * Two of the common methods to navigate around the void are flying with the [Jetpack](/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack") and by building [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations").



### Mountains

There are a lot of tall mountains in the game. The highest point is located at the North of Rocky Desert. It is a rock pillar, standing 488 meters high above sea level, or Z:470m. One of the four uranium nodes, this one being impure, is on the very top. 

### Sea

  * There are 2 seas in the world; One bordering the North and West sides of the map, and one on the East side. Both sea levels are set at Z:-18, as such 18 meters above sea level will be referred to as '0 meter' high.
  * There is a small void in the North East where the North sea visually flows into the void with a waterfall, however the entire area is swimmable and [Water Extractors](/wiki/Water_Extractor "Water Extractor") can be placed there. 
    * NOTE WELL: The swimmable area transitions suddenly to void with no visual indications. Care is advised.



### Lakes and Other Water Sources

There are lakes, rivers, and shorelines in almost every biome that can be used as water sources. 

Flowing streams and rivers _(of a certain size)_ , and waterfalls, as of [Version 1.0](/wiki/Patch_1.0 "Patch 1.0") all now have water force, which will move any swimming Pioneers or Creatures in the direction of water flow to include being possibly sent over the edge of a waterfall. _Vehicles are unaffected by water force._[9][10][11]

#### Water extraction

Since water is a resource in the game, elevation changes can be used in place of pumps to move water. Water extractors are still required. 

Significant Water Sources and their Elevations _Note: This is not an exhaustive list of sources for water extraction. All measurements are standing at waterline. Note some values are negative._ Water Feature  | Elevation (meters)   
---|---  
Red Bamboo Jungle Lake  | 233   
Dune Desert Abyss Cliffs  | 228   
Crater Lakes  | 154   
Twin Falls Lake (between Bamboo forest and Northern Forest)  | 130   
Lake Forest Biome Lake  | 97.3   
Lake above Giant Falls into Swamp  | 93.5   
Dune Desert Oasis Lakes  | 55.3   
Western Dune Forest (Upper Lake)  | 2.3   
Upper Lake in Grass Fields  | -7.3   
Swamp  | -17   
Gold Coast Shoreline  | -17.5   
Rocky Desert Lake  | -17.7   
Dune Desert Northern Shoreline  | -18.4   
Grass Fields Lake (North)  | -26.8   
Western Dune Forest (Lower Lake)  | -55.4   
Blue Crater Lake  | -93.9   
  
## World size

  * The world size is _roughly_ 5.4 km x 5.4 km as mentioned officially. However, this refers to the land mass of the "island", or the playable world. The actual world size, including the void and the sea, is 7.972 km x 6.8 km. 
    * This translates into 996.5 x 850 foundations.
  * Pioneers take damage beyond Z:-244 m (underground) and Z:1997 m (sky), measured on the foundation the pioneer is standing on. 
    * It is not measured whether the z-axis border is at a uniform height.
  * The theoretical build-able area is 47.112 km2 and volume is 105.578 km3. 
    * On the x-y plane, it takes at least 736127 [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations") to cover up the entire build-able area.
  * The tallest factory building in-game is the [Particle Accelerator](/wiki/Particle_Accelerator "Particle Accelerator") with 32 meters high, and the slimmest foundation is 1 meter high. This means at least a 68-floor factory can be built, each housing at least a Particle Accelerator (the 68th floor will have the top of the building slightly above the sky's safe zone). 
    * The tallest building of any category in the game is the [The HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB") which has a height that goes to the skybox. If The HUB is covered by foundations above, its freighter will clip though it during launching and landing animations.
  * The areas east of the Swamp biome, north of the Rocky Desert, and around the Islands Biome are ideal locations for building large structures over water due to the large water area without the world border being close to land.



## Gravity

  * The world's gravitational acceleration is measured to be about 11.85 m/s² (slightly stronger than Earth's).
  * Despite the stronger gravity, pioneers can jump higher and farther in the game than real-life humans.
  * When falling from a height, pioneers quickly reach the terminal velocity, which is 40 m/s (downward).
  * Most creatures, except [Stingers](/wiki/Stinger "Stinger"), can receive [fall damage](/wiki/Fall_damage "Fall damage") due to gravity.



## Traversal

Regardless of where you are in the world and what parts of it are loaded, your [factories](/wiki/Building "Building") and [vehicles](/wiki/Vehicle "Vehicle") will continue to run.[12]

Players are discouraged from exploring off the edges of the map by a lack of resources and collectibles. If a player continues out of pure curiosity, they will go out-of-bounds, and begin taking about 5 HP per second in [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage"). Unlike the poison gas, the out-of-bounds damage can be blocked by piloting a vehicle. The out-of-bounds damage can also be blocked by traveling in a [Hyper Tube](/wiki/Hyper_Tube "Hyper Tube"). Buildings can be constructed as normal in the out-of-bounds zone. 

## World border

[](/wiki/File:World_Border_Map.png)

[](/wiki/File:World_Border_Map.png "Enlarge")

Version 1.0 Map border as of [Patch 1.0.0.4](/wiki/Patch_1.0.0.4 "Patch 1.0.0.4") [13][14]

  * The 'death border' is not a cuboid. On the x-y plane, it is polygon shaped. 
    * Traveling beyond the edge of the damage border will reduce the pioneer's [health](/wiki/Health "Health") at 5 HP/sec. When standing near a vertex of the map border, the damage rate is doubled as the pioneer receives the damage from 2 map borders at the same time.
    * Surrounding the damage border (marked red) is the instant death border which is located at some distance beyond that, it is located at all sides including the z-border. 
      * The instant death border or "kill zone" is limited in size and can be passed through using [Trains](/wiki/Electric_Locomotive "Electric Locomotive") or [Hypertube](/wiki/Hypertube "Hypertube") after which the pioneer stops taking damage _CREDIT: Reddit Member u/AlguienAlgo_.[15][16]
  * Pioneers can further build out 100 meters beyond the death border while staying within the border. Buildings are not be damaged by this border. While in a vehicle the pioneer is immune to [out-of-bounds damage](/wiki/Vehicles#Out-of-bounds_damage "Vehicles").



## Spawn area

[](/wiki/File:Map_Spawn_Points.png)

[](/wiki/File:Map_Spawn_Points.png "Enlarge")

Start Area Spawn Range

When you start a [new game](/wiki/New_game "New game"), during which you select one of the world starting areas, after game planetfall intro, you will land somewhere within an area shown on the image to the right, depending on the start area chosen. 

  * **Start Area 1:** Grass Fields Biome.
  * **Start Area 2:** Rocky Desert Biome.
  * **Start Area 3:** Northern Forest Biome.
  * **Start Area 4:** Dune Desert Biome.



## Roads

[](/wiki/File:Map_Roads.png)

[](/wiki/File:Map_Roads.png "Enlarge")

Map "roads"

The game does not have actual "roads", however there are ground areas which are easier to travel by [motor vehicles](/wiki/Vehicles#Motor_vehicles "Vehicles"), or provide good areas to build rail networks for [Trains](/wiki/Train "Train") as shown on the image to the right. 

The pioneer has the option of building actual "roads" via use of [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations#Asphalt-0 "Foundations"), perhaps also using asphalt material, along with [Customizer Patterns](/wiki/Customizer#Patterns "Customizer"). 

## World grid

_Main article:_[ Foundations > World grid](/wiki/Foundations#World_grid "Foundations")

World grid refers to the global grid system which [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations") can be snapped to. 

## Tips

  * The selection of a starting zone does not limit the scope of a pioneer's exploration and expansion. A pioneer can both explore and expand their factories and transportation systems into all the biomes available in the new game selection screen.

## Narrative

**Expand to reveal spoiler**

When performing specific actions, the player will hear [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA") speak. 

  * View [Story Player Actions - Out Of Bounds](/wiki/Story#Player_Actions "Story") to read and hear individual ADA messages related to passing a World Border, or exceeding **Z:-244 meters** (underground) or **Z:1997 meters** (sky), and receiving damage.



## Trivia

  * Internally, the x, y and z coordinates are measured in centimetres (cm).
  * The large mountain, visible in the backdrop to the west-southwest, is an accurate resemblance of the real [Mount Matterhorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matterhorn "wikipedia:Matterhorn").
  * There will be no snow/arctic biome,[17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27] and no seasonal winter changes that lead to snow.[28]
  * The name of the ringed planet added in the Update 6 skybox improvements is "Rebecca"[29]
  * The Spire Coast Biome _was_ going to be a Lava Biome, along with new hazards, but that idea was scrapped due to it scope and complexity, and the Spire Coast became the tropical biome it is today which has elements which implies it was created via volcanic means.[30]
  * Both the Western Dune Forest Biome and Eastern Dune Forest Biome were based on the Dutch named areas where you find a forest within sand dunes called [Soester Dunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soester_Dunes) _(Dutch: Soester Duine)_ and [De Loonse en Drunense Duinen National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Loonse_en_Drunense_Duinen_National_Park).[31]
  * Most caves which have [Resource Nodes](/wiki/Resource_Node "Resource Node") in them were designed to allow for the use of [Trains](/wiki/Train "Train") if desired by the Player. Some of the 150+ caves in the world were build by employees at CSS that wanted to learn world building.[32]
  * CSS Level Designer Hannah Beuger mentions one cave in the Lake Forest Biome is known internally as "Hannah Test Cave" since it was the first cave she built using all the new cave assets introduced in Update 5 as [seen here](https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Cave#/media/File:Update_5_Teaser_Cave.webp) for example.[33]
  * Using the 1.0 release trailer's view of Massage-2(AB)b, it is possible to find that the planet's diameter is approximately 63km, which is about 0.5% of Earth's diameter.
  * The name of the planet is explained in-game by ADA:



**Expand to reveal spoiler**

According to ADA: "Fun fact: the planet you are on was found and named during a planet-spotting event Marie hosted called 'Marie's Awesome Scientific Search of the Avant-Garde: Exoplanets'." 

  * [](/wiki/File:ADA_-_MASSAGE-2\(A-B\)b.png "ADA message about the origins of the planet name of MASSAGE-2\(A-B\)b.")
