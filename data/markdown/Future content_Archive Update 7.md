## Features

  * Gamemode support, with the only planned gamemode removing creature aggression. More gamemodes, like creative, will come later.[U7 7]
  * Power generator [clock speed](/wiki/Clock_speed "Clock speed") changes, fixing the issues with power generation buildings.[U7 8]
    * Their operating rate will match the clock speed (250% clock speed means the generator will burn 2.5× the fuel and produce 2.5× the power).
    * [Nuclear Power Plants](/wiki/Nuclear_Power_Plant "Nuclear Power Plant") will have their [Water](/wiki/Water "Water") requirement reduced, so 250% clock speed can be used with the flow limit of [Mk.2 Pipelines](/wiki/Pipeline "Pipeline").
  * The [AWESOME Sink](/wiki/AWESOME_Sink "AWESOME Sink") will have 2 separate [coupon](/wiki/FICSIT_Coupon "FICSIT Coupon") counters, one that uses only [Organic Data Capsules](/wiki/Organic_Data_Capsule "Organic Data Capsule") and one that uses the other parts. This will incentivize fighting enemies to earn points from the data capsules. Coupon costs for items in the [AWESOME Shop](/wiki/AWESOME_Shop "AWESOME Shop") will also be re-balanced.[U7 9]
  * Automatic snapping of [Conveyor Belts](/wiki/Conveyor_Belts "Conveyor Belts") to walls and ceilings (similar to [Power Lines](/wiki/Power_Line "Power Line")), the latter using a new ceiling mount[U7 10]
  * Blueprinting, with each blueprint being limited to a volume of 32m x 32m x 32m, or 4 foundations cubed.[U7 11]
    * Blueprints are created by placing structures within a new Designer building, where they can be saved or overwritten.
    * Blueprints are not tied to a save session, rather being stored separately as files, making it possible to share them, but being unable to sync them using cloud saves.
    * Placing blueprints in a session is not possible until the Designer building is unlocked in that session; once unlocked, they can be accessed from a tab in the build menu.



## Buildings

  * Conveyor Belt Ceiling Mount[U7 10]
  * Designer[U7 11]
    * Used to create and edit blueprints



## Other

  * There are no plans to add new weapons.[U7 12]
