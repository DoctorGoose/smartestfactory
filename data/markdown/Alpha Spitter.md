## Behavior

Alpha Spitters will regularly make a hissing noise to alert pioneers. They will begin to attack pioneers that come nearby, unless they are in a vehicle. 

If a pioneer is within melee range of the Spitter, it will shoot a defensive fireball with large knockback. The closer the distance, the higher the damage. Otherwise, it will do one of the two ranged attacks (see table above). All attacks deal area damage. 

### Spawning

Alpha Spitters usually spawn singularly, but may be accompanied by one or more regular [Spitters](/wiki/Spitter "Spitter"), and can be prevented from spawning by using [creature respawn prevention methods](/wiki/Creatures#Respawning "Creatures"). 

## Tips

  * The large fireball shot by the Alpha Spitters can be destroyed with melee and ranged weapons. 
    * It's usually more practical to do this than to attempt to dodge it, as it has a huge radius; for reference, if an Alpha Spitter shoots a large fireball at you from a moderate distance while you are on the ground, and you attempt to dodge it by flying up with a Jetpack, it will still hit you even if you continuously fly up from when it shoots the fireball to when it explodes on the ground.



## Achievements

## Trivia

  * It is possible to attach a [Nobelisk](/wiki/Nobelisk "Nobelisk") to the fireball, which will explode when the fireball hits something.
