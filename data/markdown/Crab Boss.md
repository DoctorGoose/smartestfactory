## Crab Boss

[ ](/wiki/File:Crab_Boss.png "Crab Boss.png")

## Lifeform

### Behavior

Hostile

The **Crab Boss** is a placeholder name given to a giant creature seen in the E3 trailer as well as briefly in the Animation Highlight, [1][2][3] and was named "Melk" on the side of a photoshopped carton of milk in the Update 6 initial information video.[4]

In a Q&A video released by Coffee Stain, the creature was referred to as a "Big Angry Crab", and it has been hinted at its implementation in the future,[5] although as of January 2023, and later in October 2023, it was announced the Crab Boss was currently "on ice".[6][7] It has been later revealed that the reason it's not implemented yet is due to pathfinding issues.[8]

## Speculation

  * It could be some kind of boss.
  * It is possible that the [Flying Crab Hatchers](/wiki/Flying_Crab_Hatcher "Flying Crab Hatcher") are its eggs. This is especially reasonable speculation considering that the Crab Boss is shown throwing Flying Crabs at the [pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer") in the E3 trailer.
  * Though it may be the same species as the [Flying Crabs](/wiki/Flying_Crab "Flying Crab"), it appears to be standing on the ground rather than flying, which means it could be incapable of flight. It is also seen screaming/roaring, which hints towards a different sound than the Flying Crabs.
  * One of the animations featured in a developer highlights video includes what appears to be a lone [crab larva](/wiki/Flying_Crab "Flying Crab") riding the back of the Crab Boss, with one arm raised as if to wave the player off to their death as they're attacked by a swarm of its siblings.[9]
  * With the addition of the [Boom Box](/wiki/Boom_Box "Boom Box"), introduced in [Patch 0.6.1.0](/wiki/Patch_0.6.1.0 "Patch 0.6.1.0") on 20 September 2022, it was noted that using **Turbo Bass** you can quickly kill or damage lots of Creatures like Flying Crabs as as shown in a Update 6 Trailer[10] further leading to the speculation about potential addition of the Crab Boss to the game.



## Version 1.0

  * In February 2024 we learned that the Crab Boss will **not be in Version 1.0 Release**[11] planned for later in the year. There is still a chance it might be added in a Post-Version 1.0 release update.
