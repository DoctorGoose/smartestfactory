## Intro

Hi Pioneers! 

Today all changes that have been on Experimental (plus a few additional bug fixes) are making their way on to the Early Access version! This includes a whole lot of bug fixes and some additions to the game that I will be going over in short, but make sure to check out the patch notes below where we have summarized all of it. 

The biggest changes we are introducing is a substantial increase to the fluid transport capacity of Trains and an increase to the fluid storage capacity of Buffers, a new overflow setting for Smart & Programmable Splitters, and the ability to map out a total of 10 different Hotbars and switch between them quickly. 

On top of those changes the Train Platforms, standard Conveyor Poles, Chainsaw, and Object Scanner got an update to their looks. A lot of smaller feedback improvements have been implemented in the UI as well and this version includes the new Epic Online Services implementation, which you largely shouldn’t notice. It does give you all the ability to connect to sessions via a Session ID without having to be on someone’s friend list. 

There are a lot more tweaks and changes, including 50+ bug fixes of which many are addressing client bugs. Let us know on the questions site if any issues persist, or new ones pop up.

Hope all of you will enjoy this patch! <3
