**Pipelines** are used to transport [fluids](/wiki/Fluids "Fluids") between structures. The Mk.1 Pipeline can transfer up to 300 m3/min, the Mk.2 twice as much. [Head lift](/wiki/Head_lift "Head lift") has to be applied to transport liquid fluids vertically, which can be increased using [Pipeline Pumps](/wiki/Pipeline_Pump "Pipeline Pump"). 

The volume of each Pipeline segment is set by its length. Default Pipelines have Flow Indicators; "clean" variants without them can be purchased in the [AWESOME Shop](/wiki/AWESOME_Shop "AWESOME Shop") after each respective mark is unlocked.

## Construction

Pipelines have six construction modes: Auto, Auto 2D, Noodle, Horizontal to Vertical, Curve and Straight. Different build modes can be cycled by either pressing or holding [`R`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). 

  * Auto: The default build mode. The pipeline segment takes a straight line path, with a circular curve at one or both ends (as necessary) to align to the orientation of each end.
  * Auto 2D: Similar to Auto mode, but the curves at either end of the pipeline are kept horizontal, with only the pipeline between the curves taking a sloped angle. The circular arcs also have a much smaller radius which is useful for tight turns when building a pipeline in another build mode is not possible, though this only works when both ends are at the same height.
  * Noodle: The pipeline will try to maximize its curvature radius such that it appears smooth, and it is calculated by aligning its arc tangent at both the starting and ending points. Can produce wide sweeping curves, but can also be used in tighter spaces.
  * Horizontal to Vertical: The pipeline will attempt to maintain the same level as the starting point (traveling horizontally), then turns vertically when approaching the ending point. If there's not enough height difference between the two ends for a vertical section then it behaves more like Auto mode, producing a sloped pipe.
  * Curve: The pipeline will be curved in a way similar to [railways](/wiki/Railway "Railway"), according to the position and orientation of the starting and ending points. The entire pipeline segment forms a continuous circular arc between its ends.
  * Straight: Will auto-correct to prevent clipping (if possible) making straight pipelines with perfect 90° corners.[1][2][3][4]



Pipelines have a minimum turning radius of two meters. When building pipelines at a 90-degree turn, count two meters or two 'grids' from the turning point. Their graphical appearance may display that the radius is smaller than two meters, but it is still impossible to build a turning point of two meters. 

When a Pipeline is modified by either inserting or removing a [Pipeline Junction Cross](/wiki/Pipeline_Junction_Cross "Pipeline Junction Cross") or a [Pipeline Pump](/wiki/Pipeline_Pump "Pipeline Pump") onto it, all its fluid contents are emptied. 

### Pipeline Support

_Main article:_[Pipeline Supports](/wiki/Pipeline_Supports "Pipeline Supports")

When building from a fixed point to a free point, a [Pipeline Support](/wiki/Pipeline_Support "Pipeline Support") will be automatically added to the 2nd point, including its building cost. The support itself is confirmed in two stages. The first stage confirms the rotation of the support along its vertical axis; this is adjusted with the mouse scroll wheel. The second stage confirms the height and pitch--the former adjusted by looking at the desired height (max. seven meters) and the latter adjusted via the mouse scroll wheel. Each build stage is confirmed with[](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left"). 

The center point of a Pipeline Support is positioned at 1.8 meters above the Foundation it is snapped on. This also applies to Pipelines with their Pipeline Supports removed. 

## Usage

  * [](/wiki/Dark_Matter_Residue "Dark Matter Residue") [Dark Matter Residue](/wiki/Dark_Matter_Residue "Dark Matter Residue")



A Pipeline segment can only contain one type of fluid at a time. The icon of the fluid has the same appearance as a Flow Indicator containing it. 

Pipelines have a storage capacity of 1.327 m3 per meter length. 

### Flow Indicator

[](/wiki/File:Pipeline_indicator.png)

[](/wiki/File:Pipeline_indicator.png "Enlarge")

The pipeline indicator is marked within a cyan rectangle. It appears retracted as there is no fluid content in it.

When a Pipeline segment contains a straight part a minimum of six meters long, a Flow Indicator will appear in the middle of the segment, which is a set of three rings on a retractable rail. Each indicator displays the following information: 

  * Type of fluid content: the color of the window (the middle part that is exposed) corresponds to the type and color of the fluid it is carrying.
  * Amount of fluid: the distance between the 1st and 3rd ring along the pipe corresponds to the % amount fluid. If the segment is full, then the rings are fully separated. If the segment is empty, all the rings collapse in the middle.
  * Flow direction: Indicated by the pattern of the pulses. The first ring that expands indicates the fluid is flowing from that direction. The fluid flows towards the 3rd ring.
  * Flow rate: By the amount the rings expand. If the flow rate is very low, the rings barely 'breathe'.



The pulse rate is always maintained at one pulse per second. 

#### Removal

A variant of each Pipeline that doesn't have flow indicators called **Clean Pipeline** can be purchased in the [AWESOME Shop](/wiki/AWESOME_Shop#Management "AWESOME Shop"). Rebuilding pipeline using standard pipelines will restore the flow indicator. 

### Flushing

Pipeline contents can be emptied by interacting with a segment of it (default [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")) and then turning the flush lever in its UI. There are two options: 

  * Pipe Segment - Only that segment is flushed.
  * Full Pipe Network - All pipes connected to the selected pipe are flushed.



### Head lift

_Main article:_[Head lift](/wiki/Head_lift "Head lift")

[Fluids](/wiki/Fluids "Fluids") in a Pipeline can flow between different elevations based on the head lift. Head lift is not required for perfectly horizontal Pipelines. A Pipeline has an outer radius of about one meter, while the "inner radius" is set to be 0.65m. Thus, a perfectly horizontal Pipeline requires around 1.3m of head lift to be filled. (On the head lift indicator on a connected [Pipeline Pump](/wiki/Pipeline_Pump "Pipeline Pump"), this value can vary between 1.2 to 1.5 m) 

Head lift does not apply to [Gases](/wiki/Fluids#Gases "Fluids"). 

### Sloshing

Any type of dead-end junction (be that actual dead ends or a side-line becoming full) will cause fluid to flow back (slosh), which interrupts the pipe, causing it to drop below 600 m3/min. Some believe this is an issue but it is NOT as **this is by design and normal.** [5]

Sloshing is _common_ when using a [pipeline manifold](/wiki/Pipeline_manifold "Pipeline manifold"), and to prevent sloshing, two solutions are available; the first is to run machines connected to the pipe _only_ when all pipes are completely full and will stay full, and the second is to use a loopback pipe as depicted below. 

  * [](/wiki/File:Pipeline_Manifold_Schematics.png "Schematic of the pipeline manifold layout, with a loopback pipe")

Schematic of the pipeline manifold layout, with a loopback pipe




## Overflow Valve

There is currently no distinct building in-game that allows for a controlled overflow of fluids in a pipeline. However, there is a workaround by building the following: 

  * The higher priority fluid consumers should be directly connected to the fluid source with a pipe.
  * The lower priority fluid consumers should be connected, in series, at the end of the line, with a section of 10 meter high pipes in-between to restrict the flow. Therefore, when the preceding pipeline is full, the fluid will pass through the restriction.
  * If an overflow sink is desired, the fluid can be either packaged and [sunk](/wiki/AWESOME_Sink "AWESOME Sink"), or (preferably) used up in recipes, such as [Wet Concrete](/wiki/Concrete "Concrete") for [Water](/wiki/Water "Water").


  * [](/wiki/File:Liquid_overflow_schematic.png "Using head lift and distancing to prioritize the Fuel generators over packaged fuel.")

Using head lift and distancing to prioritize the Fuel generators over packaged fuel.

  * [](/wiki/File:Pipeline_overflow_with_head_lift.png "Stacking five Stackable Pipeline Supports to introduce a head lift of 10 meters high to restrict the fluid flow. Only when the previous pipe is full, the fluid can pass through it.")

Stacking five Stackable Pipeline Supports to introduce a head lift of 10 meters high to restrict the fluid flow. Only when the previous pipe is full, the fluid can pass through it.




This works based on the following principles: 

  * Pipes nearer to the fluid source (such as [Extractors](/wiki/Extractor_\(disambiguation\) "Extractor \(disambiguation\)"), [Refineries](/wiki/Refinery "Refinery")) will be filled first - therefore buildings connected to such pipes will be prioritized.
  * Pipes will obey the laws of gravity - pipes at a lower height will fill up before pipes at a taller height.
  * Pipes well beyond the generated head lift will never fill up.

## Trivia

  * Pipelines were memed by the community since the start of the game,[6] with Coffee Stain continuing to participate in the meme of their non-existence right up until the launch of [Update 3](/wiki/Update_3 "Update 3"),[7][8] even joking that pipes would be removed in [Update 4](/wiki/Update_4 "Update 4").[9]
  * There are ring-shaped welding joints along the pipeline, spaced roughly one meter apart, but not exactly one meter. Do not use those rings for distance measurement.
  * Pipeline Mk.2 was first showcased in a [teaser trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_vSyaBC-yI).
  * Originally, Mk.1 Pipelines were supposed to carry 600 m3/min, but it was reduced to 300 due to technical complications.[10]
  * In an [October 1st, 2020 Q&A Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rATcozDE25c&t=528s) Pipes were jokingly requested by the community and then jokingly denied that they would ever be added. On [October 27th, 2020](/wiki/Patch_0.3.6 "Patch 0.3.6"), more pipes were added.



## Current issues

  * Placing pumps, valves or junctions directly on pipes can cause a transient throughput throttling, somewhere around 1 m3/min. On occasion, even when the junction is placed, then re-connected after dismantling the original pipe, a small segment of pipe can get stuck inside the junction, which will also cause throughput throttling. This issue affects both Mk.1 and Mk.2 pipes. The workaround is to either place the junction first, then connect pipes, or, if you must place them on a pipe for placement purposes, or in the case of valves and pumps, place junctions, pumps and valves on pipes, then delete the original pipe and reconnect. Avoid placing junctions, pumps or valves on points where different lengths of pipes connect, as this is believed to be the cause of the small segment of pipe stuck inside junctions. When searching for these choke points in an existing factory, highlight the pipes entering the affected objects. If they show as being halfway inside the object, and not just stopping at the mouth of the object, that object was placed directly on a pipe and the connecting pipes should be dismantled and new ones connected.
  * When building a vertical Pipeline, Pipeline Pumps will read a different value depending on if the pipe was built top-to-bottom or bottom to top. Top-to-bottom tends to show a value closer to the expected value, namely the pipe's height. 
    * This might be related to the known "pipeline length issue" where there was a difference in Pipe "length" depending on how a Pipeline Pump was connected.[11]
