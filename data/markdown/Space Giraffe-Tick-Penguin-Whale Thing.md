## Appearance

It looks like a whale from a distance, however, a closer look reveals a bird-like beak and head with small eyes, indicating that it may have poor eyesight. It has four very long legs, which it uses to move around and swim. 

## Behavior

The Space Giraffe-Tick-Penguin-Whale Thing is a passive creature. It will not attack the [pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer") and will not run away when approached. If attacked by a pioneer, it will attempt to gallop away from the pioneer before settling down again a short while after. It is bouncy and propels the pioneer high up into the air when jumped on, even if dead. 

Occasionally it will raise itself onto its hind legs and then drop back down. 

Space Giraffe-Tick-Penguin-Whale Things can be sometimes found swimming, but with no special animation attributed to it, making it look like they're just floating in the water. Their long legs help them to move in deep waters. 

It makes low-pitched sounds when nearby, which sound similar to water-dwelling whales found on Earth.

## Trivia

  * According to [CSS UI/UX Designer Nathalie Verweij](/wiki/Coffee_Stain_Studios#Coffee_Stain_Studios "Coffee Stain Studios") the Space Giraffe-Tick-Penguin-Whale Thing was originally designed by former CSS Level Designer [Michiel Werring](/wiki/Coffee_Stain_Studios#Former_employees "Coffee Stain Studios").[4]
  * The Space Giraffe-Tick-Penguin-Whale Thing isn't referred to anywhere in-game except for its statue, its name comes from the [Patch Closed Alpha 5](/wiki/Patch_Closed_Alpha_5 "Patch Closed Alpha 5") (and [Patch 0.1](/wiki/Patch_0.1 "Patch 0.1")) patch notes, which mentioned it for the first time. Later patch notes continue to refer to it as such, or as Space Whale/Tick/Giraffe, Space Giraffe/Tick/Whale/Penguin, or similar terms.
  * It has the most health out of any creature in the game, twice as much as the pioneer.
  * The community commonly calls it a "Bean" as shorthand. Some other names less commonly used are "Whalephant", "Tall Boi" or "Mr. Plum". 
    * When viewed in the [Codex](/wiki/Codex "Codex"), it is listed as "Unknown File Error #6265616e". If this number is run through a hexadecimal to ASCII converter, it translates to "bean".
  * This is [Snutt's](/wiki/Snutt "Snutt") favorite page.[5]
  * On April 1, 2021, the April Fools Special Event was introduced. This event was repeated on April 1, 2022. During both events, the Space Giraffe-Tick-Penguin-Whale-Thing appeared smaller.



## Current issues

  * The Space Giraffe will sometimes stop its walking animation after being attacked and switch to its unanimated default pose.
  * The path-finding of Space Giraffes is not fully implemented "as intended", they re-use the path-finding meant for smaller creatures.[_[citation needed](/wiki/Category:Citation_needed "Category:Citation needed")_] Therefore, they can be seen pathing through factories or even [Walkway Ramps](/wiki/Walkway_Ramp "Walkway Ramp") despite their large body size.
