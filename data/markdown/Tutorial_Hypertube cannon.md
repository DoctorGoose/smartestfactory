A **Hypertube cannon** is a specific setup of [Hypertube Entrances](/wiki/Hypertube_Entrance "Hypertube Entrance") and short [Hypertube](/wiki/Hypertube "Hypertube") segments, which can be used to reach very fast speeds, capable of crossing the entire playable [world](/wiki/World "World") in seconds. Hypertube Cannons abuse a bug in Unreal Engine's physics system, allowing the user to gain momentum at an exponential rate. This gain in momentum is directly dependent on the FPS of the player using the cannon. The higher the FPS of the player, the less speed the player will gain. As such, during the construction and testing, it is recommended that the player use the FPS limit feature in the graphics settings to get consistent results.

## Construction

  1. Build a row of 9 foundation tiles in the direction you want to launch.
  2. Every 4 meters, place a [Hypertube Support](/wiki/Hypertube_Support "Hypertube Support"), not placing more than 17. Chaining over 17 entrances is not recommended, as the velocity gained in the tube will shoot the player beyond the map boundary. (This does not matter for an enclosed Hypertube chain.)
  3. Place a [Hypertube Entrance](/wiki/Hypertube_Entrance "Hypertube Entrance") at the front of each segment. Note: the [Hypertube Entrance](/wiki/Hypertube_Entrance "Hypertube Entrance") can only face one direction if placed after the [Hypertube](/wiki/Hypertube "Hypertube").
  4. Place a [Hypertube Support](/wiki/Hypertube_Support "Hypertube Support") between each supported [Hypertube Entrance](/wiki/Hypertube_Entrance "Hypertube Entrance"). There should now be 2-meter gaps between each object.
  5. Place a [Hypertube](/wiki/Hypertube "Hypertube") from the first [Hypertube Entrance](/wiki/Hypertube_Entrance "Hypertube Entrance"), reach 2 meters to the first empty [Hypertube Support](/wiki/Hypertube_Support "Hypertube Support"). Repeat for every [Hypertube Entrance](/wiki/Hypertube_Entrance "Hypertube Entrance").
  6. As shown at the top of the setup diagram, remove the non-entrance [Hypertube Supports](/wiki/Hypertube_Support "Hypertube Support").
  7. The last segment determines the launch angle of the player and will significantly affect the distance travelled. (If making an enclosed cannon, just continue building a normal Hypertube chain from here.) The angle is determined by the placement of the end support, not the angle of the [Hypertube](/wiki/Hypertube "Hypertube"). The end segment [Hypertube Support](/wiki/Hypertube_Support "Hypertube Support") should be 6-8 meters from the exit of the last launch tube. 30-degree and 45-degree (farthest) upwards curves are the most common launch angles. **When placing the angled tube for the last segment, it's recommended to use Noodle mode when placing it.** This is because other modes create more sharply-angled tubes, which can cause the Pioneer to clip through the tube and shoot off into the wrong direction.
  8. Power all the entrances.



A Hypertube Cannon won't work when built vertically. To fly vertically, make a normal cannon and make the last segment's [Hypertube Support](/wiki/Hypertube_Support "Hypertube Support") point directly up. 

### Hypertube cyclotron

A variant of the cannon, a Hypertube cyclotron, could be constructed before Update 8. It does not function after the update. 

### Fully enclosed cannon

Another variant is, instead of a short upward curved tube at the last segment, the last tube is connected all the way to the destination. In this case, a Jetpack is not required for safe travel. The enclosed nature of this method allows for even higher speeds (more than 17 entrances) as being shot out of the map doesn't have to be worried about. 

The construction cost will be much higher and more tedious to build. There will be no usage flexibility to this design: the destination cannot be changed freely, as there is no mid-air travel. 

When using this variant, it is recommended to use a Hypertube brake at the exit. This is to prevent a breakdown in physics when traveling at high speeds. See [Tutorial:Hypertube brake](/wiki/Tutorial:Hypertube_brake "Tutorial:Hypertube brake")

### Transiently powered cannon

As we only need to power the cannon when we want to use it, we can instead use a switch between the cannon entrances and the supply power and place a power storage on the same grid as the entrances. With the switch off most of the time, it doesn't continuously drain power and then when you want to use it, flip the switch, wait 5-10 seconds for the storage to charge up enough (good time to equip the Jetpack) and flip the switch off again. You should have a few seconds to get into the cannon before the storage runs out. 

The advantage of this is that we only ever have the power draw of a single cannon and the energy storage to worry about. So we can build as many cannons as we like without having to worry about the cumulative load on the power grid. 

Alternatively, the use of [Priority Power Switches](/wiki/Priority_Power_Switches?action=edit&redlink=1 "Priority Power Switches \(page does not exist\)") can enable cannons to be turned off remotely, so long as you are at another Priority Power Switch. To do this connect the cannon to the "B" side of the switch and label the switch. Then add this to the lowest priority group with the other cannons. Go into the switch to remotely turn them on and off. 

## Usage

  1. **Save your game.** Furthermore, if the auto-save countdown is appearing on the screen, do not enter the Hypertube, wait for the auto-save to complete first.
  2. Equip a [Jetpack](/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack") and enter the 1st entrance for crossing the longest distance. As the flight range is affected by the speed of the pioneer entering the Hypertube, the flight range can be boosted by entering the Tube with a [Blade Runner](/wiki/Blade_Runner "Blade Runner") while running on an Mk.5 Belt. 
     * Using a Jetpack is the easiest, but if you do not have one, a [Parachute](/wiki/Parachute "Parachute") can be used instead.
  3. If overshot, reload the saved game and enter from the 2nd entrance for a shorter distance. If still overshot, enter from the 3rd entrance, etc. 
     * Generally, 17 entrances are only needed to cross the diagonal of the map. For a distance such as 2 km, 15 entrances should be enough.
  4. Build [walls](/wiki/Walls "Walls") or [U-Jelly Landing Pad](/wiki/U-Jelly_Landing_Pad "U-Jelly Landing Pad") at the other end to land safely without a Jetpack. 
     * To build the U-Jelly on the correct landing point, you may need to save first then purposely die on the landing point, then observe the position of the Death Crate to identify the exact location.
  5. Experiment with the ideal launching angle by adjusting the tilt and curvature of the last tube segment.
  6. In mid-air, use [`W`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")[`A`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")[`S`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")[`D`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to adjust your flight path. 
     * Performing sharp turns during mid-air will impact the flight range.
  7. The pioneer takes no [damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") from slamming into a wall or a vertical rock, or scratching a ground horizontally; damage is only received from falling vertically. If lands on the ground at diagonal velocity, then only the vertical component of the velocity is counted towards the [fall damage](/wiki/Fall_damage "Fall damage").



### Fast map exploration

  1. Build [The HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB") near the cannon to set your spawning point near it.
  2. Store all your inventory at a safe place, do not bring anything along.
  3. Launch across the map at any chosen angle.
  4. Kill yourself by simply letting the cannon launch you outside the map, or click respawn button in the [`Esc`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") menu.
  5. After respawn, adjust the last tube to a slightly different angle, then repeat the launch. Eventually, the entire map will be revealed.
  6. While flying, you can open the [Map](/wiki/Map "Map") [`M`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") and adjust the flight path for maximum reveal coverage.



## Distance equation

~~~~

[](/wiki/File:Information.png) | Section accuracy  This section was created using data from a single experiment, done by a single person. The results have yet to be compared properly against other experiments. Further, it may no longer be up to date due to game updates. Use these values as an approximation only.   
---|---  
  
For a Hypertube cannon with a launch angle of 45°, the flight distance will be: 

Distance=16.6356×1.4108No. of Entrances[_[citation needed](/wiki/Category:Citation_needed "Category:Citation needed")_]

assuming the Pioneer enters the cannon with close to zero initial velocity. 

Alternatively for varying launch angles: 

Distance=v2×sin⁡(2α)11.76[_[citation needed](/wiki/Category:Citation_needed "Category:Citation needed")_]

where α is the launch angle and v is the launch velocity: 

v=12.3951×1.203No. of Entrances[_[citation needed](/wiki/Category:Citation_needed "Category:Citation needed")_]

If the player correctly times a slide-jump into the first Hypertube Entrance while equipped with Blade Runners, launch velocity and travel height/distance will be vastly increased.
