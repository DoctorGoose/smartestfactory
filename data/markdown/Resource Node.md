# Resource Node

_This article is aboutResource Node, not to be confused with [Resource Well](/wiki/Resource_Well "Resource Well")_

[](/wiki/File:Miner_on_Copper_node.png "Enlarge")

A [Miner Mk.1](/wiki/Miner_Mk.1 "Miner Mk.1") on top of a copper Resource Node, producing [Copper Ore](/wiki/Copper_Ore "Copper Ore").

**Resource Nodes** are specific locations spread across the [world](/wiki/World "World") where resource extractors ([Miners](/wiki/Miner "Miner") and [Oil Extractors](/wiki/Oil_Extractor "Oil Extractor")) can be placed to automate [ore](/wiki/Ore "Ore") (or [Crude Oil](/wiki/Crude_Oil "Crude Oil")) harvesting, solid resources to be extracted manually by the [pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer"), or [power](/wiki/Power "Power") to be generated using [Geothermal Generators](/wiki/Geothermal_Generator "Geothermal Generator") on [Geyser](/wiki/Geyser "Geyser") nodes. The three nearest Resource Nodes (or batches of them) from the pioneer can be located with the [Resource Scanner](/wiki/Resource_Scanner "Resource Scanner"). 

Nodes have three possible purities, which affect how fast resources are extracted (see below). All Resource Nodes are _infinite_ , which means they cannot be depleted.

## Resource Deposit

Resource Deposits are hand-mineable rocks that are found commonly on top of Resource Nodes as well as in the world. There can be a deposit on a node, which blocks the building of Miners, until removed. 

Deposits cannot be scanned for by any means, and do not show up on the resource scanner. Finding and mining some Resource Deposits (for example, [Caterium](/wiki/Caterium_Ore "Caterium Ore"), [Sulfur](/wiki/Sulfur "Sulfur"), and [Raw Quartz](/wiki/Raw_Quartz "Raw Quartz")) is beneficial, as they can be used to unlock the corresponding [MAM](/wiki/MAM "MAM") trees, as well as the ability to scan for permanent and automatable nodes. 

[Uranium](/wiki/Uranium "Uranium") deposits are often found in areas of interest such as [Crash Sites](/wiki/Crash_Site "Crash Site") and [SAM](/wiki/SAM "SAM") Nodes, to deter players from accessing the area. Some collectibles such as [Power Slugs](/wiki/Power_Slug "Power Slug") can be hidden behind deposits, that need to be mined out first. 

The locations of deposits in the world are fixed, however the resource type is randomized (some specific deposits, such as the aforementioned uranium deposits, will not be random). Deposits are always displayed to have a purity of pure, however the amount of items received when mining them is random and typically less than 100. 

Resource Deposits can only be extracted and destroyed by mining them manually, see § Extraction. 

## Accessing

Solid Resource Nodes will often have Resource Deposit(s) on top of them, which must be mined out by hand before a [miner](/wiki/Miner "Miner") building can be placed on them. [Portable Miners](/wiki/Portable_Miner "Portable Miner") can be placed on them without clearing the deposit. There are also often [hostile creatures](/wiki/Combat "Combat") spawned nearby to make accessing the node more challenging. 

Some Resource Nodes, such as [Caterium Ore](/wiki/Caterium_Ore "Caterium Ore"), can be blocked by large round [boulders](/wiki/Boulder "Boulder") with cracks on them. These boulders can be detonated using a [Nobelisk Detonator](/wiki/Nobelisk_Detonator "Nobelisk Detonator") or [Explosive Rebar](/wiki/Rebar_Gun#Explosive-0 "Rebar Gun"). These boulders block the placement of buildings, but not the placement of [Portable Miners](/wiki/Portable_Miner "Portable Miner") or the ability to manually mine the resource.

## Extraction

The extraction methods depend on whether the node or deposit produces a solid resource, fluid resource or is a Geyser. 

  * Solid nodes and Resource Deposits: 
    * Manual hand-mining with a chisel. Simply approach it and interact (default [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")). If your inventory is full, you will not be able to start mining. 
      * Tapping [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") will toggle mining until it is pressed again, while holding [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") will mine until it is released.
    * Placing a [](/wiki/Portable_Miner "Portable Miner") [Portable Miner](/wiki/Portable_Miner "Portable Miner") on it. Equip the Miner into your hand slot, [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") to place down. You can place multiple Portable Miners on the same node. As the internal storage of a Portable Miner is limited, and it lacks an output, you need to take out the mined ore manually.
    * Placing a [](/wiki/Miner "Miner") [Miner](/wiki/Miner "Miner") building on it. This is the only way to fully automate the mining process. Only one [Miner](/wiki/Miner "Miner") can be built on each Resource Node. 
      * Miner buildings can be only placed on Resource Nodes that are clear of Resource Deposits. However, they work through [foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations").
  * Fluid nodes: 
    * Building an [](/wiki/Oil_Extractor "Oil Extractor") [Oil Extractor](/wiki/Oil_Extractor "Oil Extractor") on an Oil node.
    * Building a [](/wiki/Resource_Well_Pressurizer "Resource Well Pressurizer") [Resource Well Pressurizer](/wiki/Resource_Well_Pressurizer "Resource Well Pressurizer") on the main node of a [](/wiki/Resource_Well "Resource Well") [Resource Well](/wiki/Resource_Well "Resource Well"), and [Resource Well Extractors](/wiki/Resource_Well_Pressurizer#Extractor-0 "Resource Well Pressurizer") on the surrounding nodes. 
      * Scanning a Resource Well will show a notched ring around the fluid icon. Hovering over the icon on the map will show the total number of impure, normal and pure nodes as circles - hollow circles are unclaimed, while filled circles are claimed.
  * Geyser: 
    * Building a [](/wiki/Geothermal_Generator "Geothermal Generator") [Geothermal Generator](/wiki/Geothermal_Generator "Geothermal Generator") on it. This is the only purpose of Geysers.

## Purity

Node purity | Building multiplier | Manual mining amount   
---|---|---  
Impure | × 0.5 | 1   
Normal | × 1.0 | 2   
Pure | × 2.0 | 3   
Resource Deposit | N/A (can only be hand mined) | 6

* Coal and Caterium nodes sometimes have [cracked boulders](/wiki/Cracked_boulder "Cracked boulder") obstructing them, which must be destroyed using [](/wiki/Nobelisk_Detonator "Nobelisk Detonator") [Nobelisks](/wiki/Nobelisk_Detonator "Nobelisk Detonator") or [Explosive Rebar](/wiki/Rebar_Gun#Explosive-0 "Rebar Gun"). 

All ores have their own Resource Deposits that are present all over the world. [Uranium](/wiki/Uranium "Uranium") nodes and deposits, just like all Uranium-based items, are [radioactive](/wiki/Radiation "Radiation"). 

Other resources  Resource | Impure | Normal | Pure | Maximum per min | Note

On wells, extracted as a fluid using resource well extractors. 300/min from pure, 150/min from normal, 75/min from impure.   
[](/wiki/Geyser "Geyser") [Geyser](/wiki/Geyser "Geyser") | 9 | 13 | 9 | - | Used for power generation using [Geothermal Generators](/wiki/Geothermal_Generator "Geothermal Generator")  
  
These Resource Nodes do not allow the construction of [Miners](/wiki/Miner "Miner") or the usage of [Portable Miners](/wiki/Portable_Miner "Portable Miner") on them. 

## Tips

  * Using an [online resource map](/wiki/Online_tools "Online tools") to determine where to build a factory can be very useful.
  * When mining a pure deposit by hand, it will yield twice as much as a pure node.
