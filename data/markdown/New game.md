## Starting location

The player can choose one of four locations to start in. They are all located on the same [Map](/wiki/Map "Map"), and regardless of the choice, the player will be able to access any of these in the course of the game. 

Start Area  | Name  | Image  | Best For  | Description  | Notes / Remarks   
---|---|---|---|---|---  
1  | Grass Fields  | [](/wiki/File:Grass_Fields_Area.png) | Ideal for first-time pioneers  | The first viable building location FICSIT had found, standing out because of its open and relatively flat fields. Considering the distances between mining locations, building outposts and/or large transportation lines may be necessary eventually.  | [note 1]  
2  | Rocky Desert  | [](/wiki/File:Rocky_Desert_Area.png) | Suitable for first-time pioneers  | The textbook example of a FICSIT-approved building location, with balanced resources, space, and distances. Additionally, it is very close to the sea, making water an easy commodity.  | [note 2]  
[note 3]  
[note 4]  
3  | Northern Forest  | [](/wiki/File:Northern_Forest.png) | Good for more experienced pioneers  | A lush building location with many height differences and few open areas, challenging conventional building and planning methods. Despite these challenges, it caught our eye due to the richness of its resources.  | [note 2]  
[note 3]  
4  | Dune Desert  | [](/wiki/File:Dune_Desert_Area.png) | Recommended for advanced pioneers  | Initially considered too risky, further investigation has convinced us that this area is viable for building with its large, open spaces and plentiful mining locations. Foliage and water locations are rare and contained, making initial power set-ups challenging.  | [note 5]  
[note 4]  
  
When a chosen start location is selected, it is marked with the use of checkmark ✓ in an orange circle. 

Notes: 

  1. ↑ Despite Northern Forest Biome being first to be worked on,[1][2] the Grass Fields Biome was the first Start Area available for players.
  2. ↑ 2.0 2.1 This start area was locked during [Closed Alpha](/wiki/Alpha_Test_Weekend "Alpha Test Weekend").
  3. ↑ 3.0 3.1 This start area was unlocked in [Early Access Release](/wiki/Patch_0.1 "Patch 0.1").
  4. ↑ 4.0 4.1 This start area appeared out of order in [Update 3 Experimental Branch](/wiki/Patch_0.3 "Patch 0.3").
  5. ↑ This start area was unlocked in [Update 3 Experimental Branch](/wiki/Patch_0.3 "Patch 0.3").



## Session name

Session names need to be at least 3 characters long and are contain within the [Save File Header](/wiki/Save_files#SaveFileHeader "Save files"). 

Session names are displayed in autosave file names in the format of `{SESSION NAME}_autosave_#.sav` where "#" is a value of 0, 1, or 2. 

Manual game saves retain the session name internally, however the save file name can be anything desired by the player. 

Once a session name is entered the Start Game button is highlighted in orange and be clicked to begin in the starting location selected. 

### Naming convention

  * Session names can use most characters. _except as indicated below._
  * **CAUTION** To avoid game issues, session names should not start or end with a [`Space`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") or a [`.`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (period). Additionally, session names should not contain an [`'`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (apostrophe), or any of the following Windows Reserve Characters: 
    * [`<`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (less than)
    * [`>`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (greater than)
    * [` :`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (colon)
    * [`"`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (double quote)
    * [`/`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (forward slash)
    * [`\`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (backslash)
    * [`Bar`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (vertical bar or pipe "|")
    * [`?`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (question mark)
    * [` *`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (asterisk)



## Session type

There are two options that are similar to [Multiplayer Privacy Settings](/wiki/Multiplayer#Session_privacy "Multiplayer"): 

  * Private - this is the _default setting_ , and only allows clients join the hosted session using this game save if invited using in-game invites.
  * Friends Only - this allows anyone in the host's friend list to join the hosted session using this game save.



## Skip intro

By checking the checkbox the game will skip onboarding, and begin in the starting location selected with the [HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB") fully built, and [Tier 1](/wiki/Milestones#Tier_1 "Milestones") unlocked. 

## Multiplayer settings

During the start of a new game save you can set Multiplayer settings for that game session as follows: 

Option  | Default  | Effect   
---|---|---  
Single Player  | Single Player  | You want to play the game alone. Nobody will be able to join you, no matter what.   
IP  | Advanced method of hosting a multiplayer game. Does not require login to any service but it might require setting up port forwarding. Others will be able to join you using your IP address that you will have to share with them independently.   
Steam  | Requires login to Steam. Other Steam players might be able to join you, depending on visibility preferences.   
Epic  | Requires login to Epic Games. Players from Steam or Epic Games will be able to join your session.   
  
See also [Multiplayer Settings](/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer"). 

## Advanced game settings

During the start of a new game save you can optionally enable [Advanced Game Settings](/wiki/Advanced_Game_Settings "Advanced Game Settings"). 

**CAUTION:** It is not possible to disable Advanced Game Settings on a particular save file once they have been enabled.

Version 1.0 new game screen showing [Advanced Game Settings](/wiki/Advanced_Game_Settings "Advanced Game Settings") warning.




## Mod savegame settings

If game mods are loaded you will see **MOd Savegame Settings >** shown on the right. This contains options specific to various Game Mods. 

## Narrative

**Expand to reveal spoiler**

Upon starting a new game the player views an intro cutscene where they hear [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA") and an _Alien Entity_ first speak. 

  * View [Story Intro Sequence](/wiki/Story#Intro_Sequence "Story") to read narrative.
