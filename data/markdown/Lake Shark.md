## Lifeform

### Behavior

Passive (flees when approached)

The **Lake Shark** was a aquatic lifeform that could only be seen in inland bodies of water. It was removed in [Update 3](/wiki/Patch_0.3 "Patch 0.3") infrequently discussed since then to the point that some [Coffee Stainers](/wiki/Coffee_Stain_Studios#Employees "Coffee Stain Studios") were unaware of its existence until over a year after it was removed.[1]. As of September 2023 it is currently intended that its previous existence will be ignored [when the game launches (i.e. 1.0)](/wiki/Future_content "Future content") and not be given a lore reason for its removal.[2]

## Behavior

The Lake Shark swam very quickly and would patrol within its lake. Due to there being no underwater swimming available to the player, not much could be learned. 

During its 'patrol', the Lake Shark would dive deeper into the water, possibly staying a certain distance from the lake-bed. It had also been observed diving when passing near the player, this behavior was consistent while the player is on land or buildings outside the water. When diving to avoid the player, the Lake Shark would disappear under the lake-bed, and then reappear nearby. 

At lakes where this creature had been seen, the [Space Giraffe-Tick-Penguin-Whale Thing](/wiki/Space_Giraffe-Tick-Penguin-Whale_Thing "Space Giraffe-Tick-Penguin-Whale Thing") would wade into the water, and both creatures appeared to ignore each other. 

Large and small Lake Sharks had been observed, with larger Lake Sharks only being seen in lakes, and smaller Lake Sharks appearing in smaller ponds. 

## Combat

Because weapons cannot be used while swimming, as well as the creature's speed, it is unknown if Lake Sharks could be killed. However, shooting them with the [Rifle](/wiki/Rifle "Rifle") wouldn't kill it.
