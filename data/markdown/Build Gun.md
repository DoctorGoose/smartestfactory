[](/wiki/File:Construction_Hologram.png "Enlarge")

A construction hologram.

The **Build Gun** is a tool [pioneers](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer") can use to place, dismantle and [customize](/wiki/Customizer "Customizer") [buildings](/wiki/Buildings "Buildings") and [vehicles](/wiki/Vehicles "Vehicles").[1] It projects a hologram showing where the buildable structure will be placed,[2] and highlighting key features such as Conveyor and Pipeline inputs, outputs and power connectors. Valid placements appear blue, hard clearance appears red, and soft clearance appears yellow; the colors for all placement validities can be freely customized in [Settings](/wiki/Settings "Settings"). 

It is also the same tool that does [resource scanning](/wiki/Resource_Scanner "Resource Scanner").[3] The pioneer will equip the tool before exiting the [drop-pod](/wiki/Drop-pod "Drop-pod"). The tool is not craftable and will still be equipped even after the pioneer respawns or dies. It also does not occupy any inventory slot. 

The construction and dismantle range is 100 meters (12.5 [foundation](/wiki/Foundation "Foundation") lengths). 

Buildings can be rotated with [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") (scroll) by default, 45° or 90° when placed on foundations. Additionally, when placing a foundation on another foundation, by using [`Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), you can rotate the foundation in increments of 10°[4] after which you can place a buildable. 

The Build Gun cannot be used while swimming; but as long as the Pioneer is above the surface of the water, most buildings can be placed submerged.

## Construction mode

Construction mode allows buildings to be constructed using materials in the [inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory"). There are various possible ways of entering construction mode: 

  * Selecting a building from the build menu ([`Q`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"))
  * Selecting a building bound to a hotbar ([`0`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")–[`9`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"))
  * Copying a building using the building eyedropper ([](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") click)
  * Searching for and selecting a building in Quick Search ([`N`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"))



It is unlocked after the pioneer has hand-mined [Iron Ore](/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore") for the first time, or if [Onboarding](/wiki/Onboarding "Onboarding") was skipped, is always available. 

Green snap guidelines will be visible to help align to inputs/outputs. 

Certain buildables require multiple clicks to be built, such as [Conveyor Poles](/wiki/Conveyor_Poles "Conveyor Poles"), [Ladders](/wiki/Ladder "Ladder"), [Flood Light Towers](/wiki/Flood_Light_Tower "Flood Light Tower"), or [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations") when Zoop mode is enabled. The first click confirms the location, allowing the structure to be raised, rotated and/or angled. An option to hold the mouse down instead of clicking twice may be enabled in [Settings](/wiki/Settings#General_3 "Settings"). 

Quick Switch allows similar buildings (such as Foundation sizes or Conveyor marks) to be cycled through by holding or pressing [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). 

Build modes, available for for most structural buildables such as Foundations, Walls, Conveyors, Pipelines and Hyper Tubes can be switched by holding or pressing [`R`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). 

[Conveyor Belts](/wiki/Conveyor_Belts "Conveyor Belts"), [Lifts](/wiki/Conveyor_Lift "Conveyor Lift"), [Pipelines](/wiki/Pipelines "Pipelines"), [Power Poles](/wiki/Power_Poles "Power Poles") and [Miners](/wiki/Miner "Miner") can be upgraded or downgraded in place by selecting the new variant and aiming on the existing building. [Walls](/wiki/Walls "Walls") have the same functionality, but [`Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") has to be held. 

### Build menu

The build menu [`Q`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") contains all the unlocked buildings sorted into individual tabs. 

In the **Builder** tab, left-clicking a building selects it for construction, right-clicking shows additional options, such as viewing them in the [Codex](/wiki/Codex "Codex") or adding them to the [To Do List](/wiki/To_Do_List "To Do List"). 

⭑ See also [Customizer](/wiki/Customizer "Customizer"), and [Blueprints](/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint") for more information. 

### Hotbar shortcuts

Buildings, Customizer (colors, finishes, materials), and Blueprints can each be bound to hotbars by hovering over them in the build menu and pressing the respective [`0`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")–[`9`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") key. Each building can only be bound to each hotbar once, but the same building can be bound to multiple hotbars. Once a building has been bound to a hotbar, it can be overwritten anytime, but a hotbar can never be cleared once anything has been bound to it. Inventory equipment cannot be bound to hotbars. 

Buildings, Customizer customizations, and Blueprints, already bound to hotbars at the bottom of the screen can be then selected with the respective key. There are ten hotbars in total, which can be cycled through by [`Alt`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")+[](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") scrolling. 

The default binds on the first hotbar are [](/wiki/Power_Line "Power Line") [Power Line](/wiki/Power_Line "Power Line"), [](/wiki/Power_Pole_Mk.1 "Power Pole Mk.1") [Power Pole Mk.1](/wiki/Power_Pole_Mk.1 "Power Pole Mk.1"), [](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt_Mk.1 "Conveyor Belt Mk.1") [Conveyor Belt Mk.1](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt_Mk.1 "Conveyor Belt Mk.1") and [](/wiki/Conveyor_Pole "Conveyor Pole") [Conveyor Pole](/wiki/Conveyor_Pole "Conveyor Pole"), while the other nine hotbars are empty. 

### Building eyedropper

Aiming at any structure or blueprint and pressing [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") will copy that structure or blueprint. Note that any configuration data, such as selected recipe or clock speed, is also copied. 

Entering dismantle mode [`F`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") previews which building is about to be copied. This can make it easier to pick the building you want, especially for small targets in cluttered areas. 

### Quick search

Quick search, accessed by [`N`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), allows any buildings to be searched up quicker than from the build menu. It additionally functions as a simple calculator, see [controls](/wiki/Controls "Controls") for details. 

### Guidelines

You will see two types of guidelines when holding [`Left Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). 

  * **Solid Color:** Seen when aligning a building from the sides.
  * **Gradient:** Seen when snapping buildable's from an input or output.



### Zoop

Zoop or Zooping [5] refers to the ability to build multiple Buildables at one time, and may have been inspired by the popular use of the [Smart Foundations Game Mod](https://ficsit.app/mod/SmartFoundations) _(now called Smart!)._

The function name of "Zoop" came from CSS Game Designer Mark Hofma (see Trivia). 

#### How to Zoop

  * Zoop Build Mode is activated by tapping [`R`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") Key to switch between Build Modes, or by pressing/holding the [`R`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") Key to bring up the Radial Menu and selecting **Zoop**.
  * You can only Zoop up to 10 at one time and only in one dimension (flat, vertical, etc.).
  * In addition to Zooping horizontally with Foundations and Walls, you can also Zoop Vertically [6] with Foundations / Ramps, Walls, and Pillars, up to a max of 10.



#### What can be Zooped

  * You can Zoop [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations"), [Ramps](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations") (both horizontally and diagonally), [Walls](/wiki/Walls "Walls"), [Roofs](/wiki/Roofs "Roofs"), [Fences / Railings](/wiki/Walls#Other "Walls"), [Walkways / Catwalks](/wiki/Walkways "Walkways"), [Pillars](/wiki/Pillars "Pillars"), [Beams](/wiki/Beams "Beams"), [Stackable Conveyor Poles](/wiki/Conveyor_Poles#Types "Conveyor Poles"), [Stackable Hyper Tube Supports](/wiki/Hypertube_Supports#Types "Hypertube Supports"), [Stackable Pipeline Supports](/wiki/Pipeline_Supports#Types "Pipeline Supports"), as well as Railway [Pillars](/wiki/Pillars#Types "Pillars"). [7][8]
  * When building your [Railway](/wiki/Railway "Railway"), you can add Pillars vertically downward from Railway using Zooping in places that are best for aesthetics. [9]
  * Using [Foundation fine rotations](/wiki/Foundations#Rotation "Foundations") along with Vertical Zooping will allow building spiral columns, circles, or other great designs. [10]
  * When Zooping Ramps they will automatically snap diagonally and there is no need to build a flat foundation prior to build another Ramp. [11]



#### What cannot be Zooped

  * [Buildings and Machines](/wiki/Buildings "Buildings") (like Constructors, Coal Generators, etc.) and [Blueprints](/wiki/Blueprints "Blueprints") cannot be Zooped. [7][12]



### Hologram lock and nudge mode

  * Pressing [`H`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") in build or blueprint mode will lock the hologram in place, so its position can be inspected and adjusted.
  * While the hologram is locked, the following actions can be performed: 
    * **Horizontal Nudging** \- The arrow keys [`↑`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (Forward), [`↓`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (Backward), [`←`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (Left), [`→`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (Right) will nudge (move) the hologram in 1m steps (Default) in a horizontal plane.[13]
    * **Vertical Nudging** \- Using [`Page up`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") and [`Page down`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") keys will nudge (move) the hologram in 1m steps (Default) in a vertical plane up or down.
    * Optionally, holding [`Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") key will nudge in horizontal or vertical 0.5m steps.
    * There is no distance limit on nudging. You can freely really refine the placement of all your buildings without having to rely on precise aiming.
  * Using [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") (LMB) will place the building/blueprint as usual.



## Dismantle mode

  * Dismantle mode has two modes: **default mod** and **blueprint mode.**
  * Dismantle mode [`F`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") allows player-built structures to be dismantled, returning 100% of the materials used to the Pioneer's inventory.
  * It is unlocked after the pioneer steps out of the [Drop-pod](/wiki/Drop-pod "Drop-pod") and listens to [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA")'s 'first objective' message. Dismantling the Drop-pod is required to obtain [HUB Parts](/wiki/HUB_Parts "HUB Parts") used to build [The HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB"). If [Onboarding](/wiki/Onboarding "Onboarding") was skipped, Dismantle mode is always available.
  * Aiming at any building or blueprint, shows the items about to be refunded, which is useful for telling what is stored within [Storage Containers](/wiki/Storage_Container "Storage Container"). Holding down [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") (LMB) for one second will dismantle the selected building. 
    * Dismantling structures with anything stored within them refunds the contents as well. _See:**Dismantle crate** below also._
  * When in blueprint dismantle mode, clicking on any buildable in a blueprint will automatically select the entire blueprint and not just the buildable selected.[14] if you dismantle some of a blueprint you can still select and dismantle the entire remaining part. [15]



### Mass dismantle

  * By holding down [`Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), up to 50 structures can be selected at once to dismantle.
  * By letting go of [`Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") and pressing it again, aiming at selected buildings deselects them instead.



### Dismantle filter

  * When using Dismantle Mode, by using [`G`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") the dismantle filter can be activated to only select buildings of the same type as the currently highlighted building.[16]
  * It is possible to select a blueprint as a filter and only dismantle the same blueprints only.[17]
  * The dismantle filter can be use with the [Customizer](/wiki/Customizer "Customizer") to only paint or apply finishes or materials to selected buildable's.[18]
    * You use the following steps - press [`F`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (Dismantle), then [`G`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (Filter), then [`X`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (Customizer), then pick a color swatch, or finish, or material, and apply to "filtered" buildable's desired.



### Invalid dismantle targets

The following are known invalid dismantle targets: 

  * Deployed placeable equipment, such as [Portable Miner](/wiki/Portable_Miner "Portable Miner"), [Statues](/wiki/Statues "Statues"), [Beacons](/wiki/Beacon "Beacon"), [Boombox](/wiki/Boombox "Boombox"), but _not_ the [Factory Cart](/wiki/Factory_Cart "Factory Cart")
  * Integrated sub-buildings, such as HUB [Biomass Burners](/wiki/Biomass_Burner "Biomass Burner"), the HUB Terminal, Train Station and Freight Platform [Integrated Platform Track](/wiki/Railway "Railway") or [Railroad Switch Control](/wiki/Railroad_Switch_Control "Railroad Switch Control")
  * [Crates](/wiki/Crate "Crate")
  * Moving [Trains](/wiki/Train "Train")
  * Dropped items
  * All non-buildings



Dismantling a sub-building will dismantle the parent building (if possible), otherwise dismantling will silently fail. 

### Dismantle crate

_Main article:_[ Crate > Dismantle crate](/wiki/Crate#Dismantle_crate "Crate")

While dismantling, if there is not enough room in the inventory, a dismantle rate with the overflow resources will spawn instead. 

## Customizer

_Main article:_[Customizer](/wiki/Customizer "Customizer")

The Customizer allows the player to edit and apply color swatches, which affect the visual appearance of buildings and vehicles, apply materials to Foundations, Walls and Roofs and apply Patterns to Foundations. It is opened with [`X`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") or by clicking its tab in the Build menu and unlocked in [Tier 2](/wiki/Tier_2 "Tier 2") \- Resource Sink Bonus Program. 

## Build clearance

_Main article:_[Build clearance](/wiki/Build_clearance "Build clearance")

Individual buildings' encroachments have a specific build clearance type (soft, hard, complex). 

## Trivia

  * When exiting the drop-pod at the start of the game, the pioneer smooths down a partly loose sticker on the Build Gun/Resource Scanner. The sticker is a picture of Box Boy from [Coffee Stain Studios](/wiki/Coffee_Stain_Studios "Coffee Stain Studios")' very first game, I Love Strawberries, released in 2010.[19]
  * The Build Gun has numerous lines of text printed on its casing. 
    * SN: 0987654321 [20]
    * RU1F-M40 [20]
    * 41PH4-BUILD 1.0 [21]
    * 54L-T [21]
  * [Snutt](/wiki/Snutt "Snutt") made the mass dismantle feature.[22]
  * Snutt mentions that the name for the function called Zoop came from came from CSS Game Designer Mark Hofma using Ladders and saying "Zoop". [23]
