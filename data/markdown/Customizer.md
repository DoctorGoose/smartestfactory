_This Build Gun software upgrade adds a new tab to the Build Menu: The Customizer. From here Pioneers have access to the Color section, as well as Material and Pattern options, purchased in the AWESOME Shop._

### Unlocked by

[Tier 2](/wiki/Tier_2 "Tier 2") \- Resource Sink Bonus Program

The **Customizer** is an expansion to the [Build Gun](/wiki/Build_Gun "Build Gun") which adds an additional tab in the Build Menu.[1]

The reason the Customizer was added was to expand the way the pioneer handled customization of buildables like Foundations, Walls, Buildings, Machines, etc.[2]

### Unlocking

You unlock the Customizer in Tier 2, Milestone 4.[3]

Initially you will only be able to paint buildables, but can later unlock the use of Materials and Patterns by purchasing them in the [AWESOME Shop](/wiki/AWESOME_Shop "AWESOME Shop") which has some progression prerequisites. 

### Accessing

The Customizer, accessed using the default key [`X`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), is used for customizing the color, material (or texture), and patterns of [buildings](/wiki/Buildings "Buildings") and [vehicles](/wiki/Vehicles "Vehicles"). The Customizer can also be accessed by clicking the 'Customizer' tab in the build menu. 

## Colors

Colors are divided into 20 swatches consisting of a Primary Color and a Secondary Color[4] which appear in one of 3 different groups (Default, Custom, and Regular). 

19 of the color swatches appearing in both the Default and Regular groups are _instanced_ , and 1 color swatch, the Custom group, is _persistent_.[5]

To use a color swatch or finish, simply click on it. After selecting a color swatch or finish, the player will be prompted to paint the target objects.

### Default

Colors in this group will affect **new buildables**. Other than Foundations, Concrete Structures, and Pipelines which have their own default swatches, the FICSIT Factory swatch is used for buildings, machines, support poles, etc.[6] and vehicles.[7]

When using any of the Default color swatches, if you later change any of these swatches using the Color Manager (see below) then every _instance_ where a particular color is used will also change.

### Custom

Unlike other color swatches, the custom swatch is "consequence-free". When using the single Custom color swatch, if you later change the swatch using the Color Manager (see below) any buildables previously painted using this color swatch will _persist_ (not change).[8]

### Color Manager

Individual Color Swatches can be edited by highlighting the swatch and clicking 'Edit' at the bottom of it which brings up the Color Manager UI.[10]

Color presets can be saved for use later by using Load Preset by clicking the 'save' icon near the bottom right, and entering a custom preset name.[11] To restore a particular color swatch, click 'Load Preset' at the bottom middle. 

Colors can be set by adjusting the individual sliders, or by manually entering a desired hex-code in the lower left, or by editing the HSV[note 1] individual values on the right to make a custom-defined HSV color space, which is different from the common HSV color space. 

  * **Hue** can be any degree value from 0° to 359°.[note 2]
  * **Saturation** can be any percentage value from 0% (Pure Grey) to 100% (Pure Color defined by Hue).[note 3]
  * **Value (or Brightness)** can be any percentage value from 0% (Black) to 100% (Full Brightness).[note 3]



Notes: 

  1. ↑ The abbreviation [HSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) stands for hue, saturation, and value, and is also often called HSB (B for brightness). 
  2. ↑ Hue degree values are shown as whole numbers 0 thru 359.
  3. ↑ 3.0 3.1 Saturation and Value/Brightness percentage values are shown as fractional numbers 0 thru 1 (example 5% would show as 0.05, 75% would show as 0.75, 100% would show as 1).

### Default assignment

Default active finishes and color swatches can be overridden by right-clicking on a finish or color swatch. Using the checkboxes, you can assign that finish or color swatch as active default finish or color for various buildable types.[12][13] See also current issues below. 

Setting a finish or color swatch as the default will not retroactively apply the selected swatch to the current existing objects of the selected type, but will set it as the default for **newly created objects of that type**. For example if Swatch 1 is right-clicked and 'FICSIT Foundation' is ticked, any current foundations won't change, but any foundations built from that point will have Swatch 1 applied. 

**NOTE:** To deselect a finish or color swatch from being an active default you must **right-click on another finish or color swatch** and set the default for _that finish or color swatch_. 

  * [](/wiki/File:Customizer_Color_Assignment.png "Customizer Color Default Assignment")

Customizer Color Default Assignment




### Hotbar assignment

Color Swatches and Finishes can be bound to a [Hotbar](/wiki/Hotbar "Hotbar") by highlighting Color Swatch or Finish and pressing the respective [`0`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")–[`9`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") key for the hotbar location where you want to place the Color Swatch or Finish. 

### Tips

The [Dismantle Filter](/wiki/Build_Gun#Dismantle_filter "Build Gun") can be use with the Customizer to only paint or apply finishes to selected buildable's.[14]

You use the following steps - press [`F`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (Dismantle), then [`G`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (Filter), then [`X`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (Customizer), then pick a color or finish and apply to "filtered" buildable's desired. 

### Color codes

See also [Custom Color Tools](/wiki/Online_tools#Custom_Color_Tools "Online tools")

## Materials

Certain architecture buildings can be retextured by changing their material. Attempting to apply a material that is already in use, or onto an incompatible building, will display an 'Invalid customization target' error. 

Materials come in various types, which appear in one of 3 different groups (Foundation, Wall, and Roof). 

  * [](/wiki/File:Customizer_Materials.png "Customizer Materials")

Customizer Materials




### Usage

You can filter the Build Menu to a specific Material by selecting the appropriate filter.[15] You can change Material prior to placement of Foundation, Wall, or Roof, by holding [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to bring up Quick Switch radial menu, and then using RMB [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right") to select the Material type you wish to use.[16]

Applying a Material when your [Inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") **is full** will result in the appearance of [inventory overflow crates](/wiki/Crate "Crate") holding the items not used in the recipe for the new Material used.[17] For example, replacing [FICSIT Foundations](/wiki/Foundations#FICSIT-0 "Foundations"), which use 5x [](/wiki/Concrete "Concrete") [Concrete](/wiki/Concrete "Concrete") and 2x [](/wiki/Iron_Plate "Iron Plate") [Iron Plate](/wiki/Iron_Plate "Iron Plate"), with [Coated Concrete Foundation Material](/wiki/Foundations#Coated_Concrete-0 "Foundations"), which uses 5x [](/wiki/Concrete "Concrete") [Concrete](/wiki/Concrete "Concrete") and 2x [](/wiki/Plastic "Plastic") [Plastic](/wiki/Plastic "Plastic"), while your inventory is full will result in one or more inventory overflow crates containing the unused 2x [](/wiki/Iron_Plate "Iron Plate") [Iron Plate](/wiki/Iron_Plate "Iron Plate").

### Hotbar assignment

Materials can be bound to a [Hotbar](/wiki/Hotbar "Hotbar") by highlighting the buildable using the desired Material and pressing the respective [`0`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")–[`9`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") key for the hotbar location where you want to place the Material.[18]

You can also assign a Material type to the hotbar by right-clicking on Material in the Customizer and selecting **Apply Material to Hotbar Buildings**.[19]

An even faster method to assign Material type to Hotbar consists of, while viewing Hotbar, pressing [`Left Alt`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") key and a number ([`0`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")–[`9`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")) for the Hotbar location which is currently using a desired Material type. This will switch ALL applicable other buildables to the same Material type _on that Hotbar_.[20]

### Tips

The [Dismantle Filter](/wiki/Build_Gun#Dismantle_filter "Build Gun") can be use with the Customizer to only apply materials to selected buildable's.[14]

You use the following steps - press [`F`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (Dismantle), then [`G`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (Filter), then [`X`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") (Customizer), then pick a material and apply to "filtered" buildable's desired.

## Patterns

Patterns can be applied to [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations") and [Roofs](/wiki/Roofs "Roofs"). 

### Usage

#### Application

Each single Foundation can only have 1 Pattern applied to its center. Patterns can be rotated with mouse wheel [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle") prior applying. 

Applying a different Pattern will replace the existing pattern, including the same Pattern with different rotation. Applying the same pattern with same rotation will display the 'Customization already applied' error since nothing has been changed. 

  * [](/wiki/File:Customizer_Pattern_Use_Example.png "Example use of Customizer Patterns")

Example use of Customizer Patterns




#### Removal

To remove a Pattern, choose 'Pattern Removal'. 

  * [](/wiki/File:Pattern_Removal.png "Pattern Removal \(Common for all Pattern Groups\)")

Pattern Removal _(Common for all Pattern Groups)_




### Color

The color of the applied Pattern follows the **Secondary Color** of the Foundation's Color Swatch that was used when Foundation was initially constructed or last updated. 

### Reflectivity

Like paint, Patterns placed on Foundations are glossy and will reflect items, buildings / machines, walls, landscape, etc., around them.[21][22]

The use of a black secondary Foundation swatch color is best to see any reflection, and the use of other colors will still have a reflection but it will be harder to see the lighter the color. White can be considered as the "least reflective" of all Pattern colors. 

### Valid targets

All Foundations, Inverted Foundations, Ramps, Double Ramps, Corner Ramps, Inverted Corner Ramps, Quarter Pipes and Inverted Quarter Pipes, and Roofs are the only valid targets for patterns. However, among these, patterns applied to glass and frame Foundations, Roofs, Quarter Pipes and Inverted Quarter Pipes **will not be visible**. 

Applying a new material to a patterned Foundation also rotates the pattern by rotating the material before applying it. 

### Groups

Customizer patterns are shown in one of 6 different groups. 

#### Arrows

  * [Snutt](/wiki/Snutt "Snutt") made a theme song for the Customizer.[26]
