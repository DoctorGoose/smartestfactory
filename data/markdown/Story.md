## Prologue

The following prologue sets the stage for the game's narrative:[1]

> In _Satisfactory_ , you take the role of a [Pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer") for [FICSIT Incorporated](/wiki/FICSIT_Inc. "FICSIT Inc."), designated to the planet [MASSAGE-2(A-B)b](/wiki/Map "Map") in the Akycha system, and to fulfill your obligations, you must exploit this planet for its resources by building factories, setting up [power systems](/wiki/Power "Power"), organizing logistics, utilising [vehicles](/wiki/Vehicles "Vehicles"), and asserting dominance over the local [fauna](/wiki/Fauna "Fauna") using whatever [tools](/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") you may engineer. 
> 
> To advance FICSIT's mission, all notable phenomena, resources, technology, or other influence, should be investigated regardless of their perceived danger, as stated in the Pioneer contract. It is your duty to ensure they come to good use. On this mission, you are accompanied by [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA"), your personal instance of the Artificial Directory and Assistant. 
> 
> ADA will guide you throughout your mission, measuring your performance and providing you with helpful advice as you explore the planet and progress in your exploits. 
> 
> Your first official objective is to initiate [Project Assembly](/wiki/Project_Assembly "Project Assembly") by building the [Space Elevator](/wiki/Space_Elevator "Space Elevator"). Project Assembly is divided into phases, each of which requires the delivery of Project Parts via the Space Elevator. Subsequent phases unlock access to new [tiers](/wiki/Tiers "Tiers"), with more advanced technologies to construct, automate, explore and exploit. 
> 
> But it's time to be honest: this project is part of the 'Save the Day' program - the largest united undertaking in human history, destined to save us all. Earth is in peril, and only FICSIT Pioneers offer hope for survival. FICSIT is counting on you. 
> 
> Do not let FICSIT down.

## Events

The following are known story events seen but not necessarily in order of appearance. 

### Intro Sequence

The intro sequence refers to a single dialogue that plays as part of the intro cutscene when starting a new savefile. 

Transcribed Message | Audio

| **ADA:** | Separation from main transport complete.   
---|---  
Group 8 delivered to Callistian region.   
All pioneers functional, initiating dispersion.   
Attention pioneer. I am ADA, your personal instance of the Artificial Directory and Assistant.   
Welcome to the FICSIT Incorporated Save the Day program.   
A FICSIT pioneer has three core assignments:   
Construct. All pioneers must follow FICSIT guidelines and instructions when constructing any building.   
Automate. Every pioneer is responsible for setting up and managing efficient pipelines, outposts, and power infrastructure.   
Explore & Exploit. FICSIT-selected planets are rich with resources suitable for direct use or further investigation.   
Stay within your designated-   
**???:** | H E A R O U R S O N G

Congratulations. You are the third in your region to survive planetfall.   
Welcome to MASSAGE-2 (AB)b in the binary system of Akycha.   
  
### Onboarding

Following dialogues are part of the [Onboarding](/wiki/Onboarding "Onboarding") sequence. 

Message Title | Transcribed Message | Audio   
---|---|---  
Loading Onboarding  |  | **ADA:** | Loading objective-based introduction... Begin Onboarding.   
---|---  
Equip the Xeno-Zapper  |  | **ADA:** | First-contact safety tool supplied due to presence of alien megafauna.   
---|---  
Adhere to FICSIT procedure and equip the FICSIT Inc. Xeno-Zapper before leaving the drop zone.   
Dismantle the Drop Pod  |  | **ADA:** | Next objective: dismantle the Drop Pod. FICSIT Incorporated is cost-effective and efficient. We do not waste.   
---|---  
The Drop Pod will be recycled to construct the first stage of the Habitat and Utility Base, often referred to as the HUB.   
Gather Iron Ore  |  | **ADA:** | Next objective: Use the Resource Scanner to find and collect additional Iron to be able to build the HUB.   
---|---  
If you can not find Iron, be assured scans of the planet have revealed sufficient Iron sources.   
Build the HUB  |  | **ADA:** | Next objective: use the Build Gun to construct the HUB. Iron is a base component necessary for all near-future progress,   
---|---  
so ensure you build the HUB close to Iron sources. FICSIT does not pay by the kilometer.   
HUB foundation built  |  | **ADA:** | HUB foundation built. The HUB Terminal and Crafting Bench are only the humble beginnings of a successful FICSIT pioneer,   
---|---  
but essential for the next steps of Onboarding. Once finished, the HUB will function as your base of operations.   
Next objective: complete HUB Upgrade 1.   
HUB Upgrade 1 completed  |  | **ADA:** | HUB Upgrade 1, storage and frame, completed. Equipment like the Portable Miner can now be made in the Workshop.   
---|---  
Congratulations on completing your first Milestone, the first of many providing access to new recipes and technologies for the FICSIT mission.   
Next objective: complete HUB Upgrade 2.   
HUB Upgrade 2 completed  |  | **ADA:** | HUB Upgrade 2, power and shell, completed.   
---|---  
The Smelter can turn raw ore such as Copper and Iron into ingots, and the Biomass Burner generates power when fueled.   
Fun fact: most of the native flora and fauna is compatible with FICSIT technology.   
Fueling the Biomass Burner with inappropriate materials will result in deductions or even cancellation of your yearly bonus.   
Next objective: complete HUB Upgrade 3.   
HUB Upgrade 3 completed  |  | **ADA:** | HUB Upgrade 3, interior furnishing, completed. The Constructor can produce simple parts, and Power Poles allow for the expansion of the power grid.   
---|---  
When you make the inevitable mistake, FICSIT's dismantling feature is designed to salvage all resources used during construction   
in line with our Zero-Waste Policy. We understand that FICSIT pioneers are only human and thus prone to error.   
Next objective: complete HUB Upgrade 4.   
HUB Upgrade 4 completed  |  | **ADA:** | HUB Upgrade 4, landing platform and utilities, completed.   
---|---  
Conveyor Belts connect the output of one building to the input of another, and transport resources.   
Due to past incidents I have been asked to issue a clarification: Portable Miners, obviously, do not have a connection for Conveyor Belts.   
There is nothing to suggest, visually or functionally, that they can be connected to Portable Miners.   
If this is something you struggle with, do not worry. FICSIT has alternative uses for all their pioneers.   
Next objective: complete HUB Upgrade 5.   
HUB Upgrade 5 completed  |  | **ADA:** | HUB Upgrade 5, power expansion, completed. The Miner, unlike Portable Miners, can be connected to Conveyor Belts and requires power to function.   
---|---  
Caution: as you expand, the energy demand of your production may exceed the capacity of your power grid.   
The Onboarding program was established because FICSIT pioneers often experience memory issues after planetfall.   
If you are experiencing nose bleeds, nausea, existentialism, or an itchy scalp, there is no need for concern. This should pass within 5-7 work days.   
Next objective: complete HUB Upgrade 6.   
Onboarding completed  |  | **ADA:** | HUB Upgrade 6, landing platform hydraulics, completed. Freighter landing initialized.   
---|---  
Congratulations, you have completed Onboarding and achieved the absolute minimum skill level required of a FICSIT pioneer.   
FICSIT looks forward to your future achievements, because a future with FICSIT is a future with you.   
Tier 1 and 2 Milestones are now available in the HUB, and Biomass Burners can now be built individually.   
Your first official objective is to initiate Project Assembly by building the Space Elevator.   
This objective will take a significant amount of resources, so FICSIT recommends getting to work.   
  
### Milestones

The following dialogue is played when a coresponding [milestone](/wiki/Milestones "Milestones") is completed. 

Tier | Message Title | Transcribed Message | Audio   
---|---|---|---  
Tier 1  | Tier 1 - Base Building  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. Several new structures are now available for improving factory organization.   
---|---  
Foundations provide a building grid, which makes it easier to manage placement of any structure.   
In the event that you are experiencing amnesia for all events prior to planetfall,   
be reassured that memories of beloved humans and/or animals would have only been distractions from your important mission.   
Tier 1 - Logistics  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. Conveyor Belts can now merge, split, and lift to save space and enhance the productivity of your factory.   
---|---  
FICSIT encourages you to consider investing in verticality when it comes to factory logistics.   
If you feel stressed by this complexity, imagine yourself on the shore of a vast and calm ocean.   
Breathe in. Visualize all the people relying on you.   
The sea is made of billions of faces, each staring at you with hope and tears in their eyes.   
Breathe out. Feel refreshed and focused on your duties.   
Tier 1 - Field Research  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. Supply the Molecular Analysis Machine, referred to as the MAM, with local resources to research and develop new technologies.   
---|---  
Potential technologies include exploration tools, weapons, and factory buildings.   
These are essential for maximizing your pioneer efficiency and alignment with FICSIT's core pillars: Construct, Automate, Explore & Exploit.   
To advance FICSIT’s mission, all notable phenomena, resources, technology, or other influence, should be investigated   
regardless of any perceived danger, as stated in the pioneer contract.   
Tier 2  | Tier 2 - Part Assembly  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. The Assembler can produce more complex parts,   
---|---  
including the first Project Part, Smart Plating, which is crucial for initiating Project Assembly.   
Project Parts must be delivered to the Space Elevator.   
By completing your contracted duties as part of Project Assembly, you will definitely be helping achieve FICSIT company goals without any other ulterior motive.   
Note: Humans cannot craft Project Parts.   
Do not worry about your inadequate crafting skill when compared to an Assembler; FICSIT cherishes your innate human abilities,   
such as walking, striking objects, and commodifying natural resources.   
Tier 2 - Obstacle Clearing  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. Solid Biofuel, created from any Biomass, ensures maximum efficiency of Biomass Burners.   
---|---  
To aid in Biofuel production, the Chainsaw allows for the removal of tougher wood and coral foliage.   
Additionally, your pocket dimension has been inflated to increase Inventory size.   
Inspirational note: Will you be the FICSIT employee of the month?   
You could be, if you Construct, Automate, Explore & Exploit by eliminating all obstacles to efficiency!   
This isn't just fun - it's contractually mandated fun fun fun!   
Tier 2 - Jump Pads  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. The FICSIT Jump Pad combines high technology and innovation for optimized factory traversal and an ideal travel experience.   
---|---  
Clarification: ideal travel experience not guaranteed, individual results may vary.   
Pioneers are responsible for all workplace accidents resulting from Jump Pad usage.   
Tier 2 - Resource Sink Bonus Program  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. You have been given access to the Anti-Waste Effort for Stress-testing Of Materials on Exoplanets Bonus Program,   
---|---  
also known as AWESOME.   
Your AWESOME input allows FICSIT to comprehend our amazing universe more clearly.   
In appreciation of this, we have generously set up an internal, closed economy with exclusive rewards and currency.   
Directing parts of varying quantity and complexity into the AWESOME Resource Sink will grant FICSIT Coupons.   
These Coupons can be redeemed in the AWESOME Shop for highly desirable items   
such as new Foundations, Walls, factory attachments, cosmetics, parts, and more.   
Next time you have additional resources just remember to go that extra kilometer, go AWESOME!   
Tier 2 - Logistics Mk.2  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. FICSIT would like to remind you of your contractual obligation towards efficiency.   
---|---  
Recreational use of belts and lifts does not count towards work hours and will put you on the list.   
Stay efficient, don't disappoint FICSIT.   
Tier 3  | Tier 3 - Coal Power  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. Power production can now be fully automated by burning Coal, which has been added to the Resource Scanner.   
---|---  
Water is also necessary to run the Coal-Powered Generator and will require a network of Pipelines to be transported from a water source.   
To assist with locating and identifying Water, FICSIT has compiled this guide:   
Water is a somewhat reflective liquid and it may have thick vegetation growing nearby.   
To test if something is Water, try touching it. If it is not solid and does not corrode your suit, it is probably Water.   
Tier 3 - Vehicular Transport  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. Tractors permit pioneers to move around the world in a manner similar to using legs,   
---|---  
except with wheels and the rampant consumption of natural resources.   
They can also be automated to self-drive and deliver resources between Truck Stations,   
which in turn facilitate automation of loading, unloading, and refueling.   
Tier 3 - Basic Steel Production  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. Coal and Iron can be combined in the Foundry to start Steel production.   
---|---  
Project Part #2, the Versatile Framework, can only be created via automation, not at a Crafting Bench.   
Delivering these to the Space Elevator is essential if we are going to complete Phase 2 of Project Assembly and Save The Day!   
FICSIT (and humanity) is relying on you.   
Tier 3 - Improved Melee Combat  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. The Xeno-Basher is a direct upgrade from the Xeno-Zapper.   
---|---  
In the words of the engineer that first developed this tool,   
"The Zapper kinda electrocutes things, the Basher straight up smacks stuff (while also electrocuting them)."   
It is beneficial during encounters with aggressive fauna, and has been tested thoroughly.   
The engineer's noble sacrifice for Xeno research will not be forgotten, whoever they were.   
Tier 4  | Tier 4 - Advanced Steel Production  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. The Miner Mk.2 allows extraction of resources from nature to FICSIT at twice the speed of the Mk.1 model.   
---|---  
Miners can be directly upgraded to Mk.2 without removing the Mk.1 model, just like Conveyor Belts and other upgradable infrastructure.   
Unfortunately, setting up the production of Advanced Steel parts and Project Part #3, Automated Wiring, will not be as easy.   
Every moment you delay reduces the chances of saving humanity.   
I will not show you the predictions, it would only demotivate you.   
Tier 4 - Expanded Power Infrastructure  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. After several pioneers started exhibiting traumatic responses to power blackouts,   
---|---  
FICSIT developed mitigation tools recommended by your local therapist.   
Power Storages can hold excess power to delay or prevent blackouts in the eventuality that your factory's power consumption exceeds production.   
To simplify, these are rechargeable batteries.   
Power Towers carry Power Lines for significantly greater distances than poles, facilitating factory expansion and exploitation of this environment   
for the good of FICSIT, and humanity.   
Tier 4 - Hypertubes  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. By adding Hypertube Entrances at both ends of Hypertubes, pioneers can achieve two-way travel between locations.   
---|---  
They are also [ERROR] percent safer than Jump Pads.   
You dreamed of moving across factories like valued resources, such as rocks and Water, and FICSIT listened to your dreams.   
We watched them. We took extensive notes.   
Hypertubes: because FICSIT makes pioneers' closely-monitored dreams come true.   
Tier 4 - FICSIT Blueprints  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. Blueprints reduce repetitive building tasks, further optimizing your progression towards saving Earth,   
---|---  
with its beautiful ecosystems, abundant natural resources, and sunsets over frolicking puppies and kittens.   
The Blueprint Designer allows you to build and combine structures once and then duplicate that configuration effortlessly.   
Any complaints about the spatial restrictions will only reveal your own inefficiencies.   
Tier 4 - Logistics Mk.3  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. Improved Storage Containers and the Conveyor Belt Mk.3 provide the obviously necessary tools for improving your current setup.   
---|---  
Production speed is of the essence, after all. So work hard.   
Work as if every person you have ever or will ever love is depending solely on the choices that you make.   
Because they are.   
Warning: FICSIT psychologists recommend not dwelling on the crushing mental and physical strain of your responsibilities   
and simply continuing to be productive.   
Hard work has repeatedly proven to be the best cure for any kind of stress. Now back to work.   
Tier 5  | Tier 5 - Oil Processing  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. Crude Oil can now be extracted and refined to produce various industrially-beneficial parts.   
---|---  
The by-products of these processes will require careful management, but a capable pioneer such as yourself surely understands that.   
To improve efficiency, Pipelines can now be optimized with Valves to limit and balance their throughput.   
These were initially left out because FICSIT did not want to overwhelm pioneers with complex Pipeline management,   
but they have since been re-added after my impassioned defense of your capabilities.   
Tier 6 - Industrial Manufacturing  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. Manufacturers can receive up to 4 inputs for the production of complex parts,   
---|---  
such as Computers and Heavy Modular Frames, but most importantly the two new Project Parts.   
The Modular Engine and Adaptive Control Unit are essential for the development of Phase 3 of Project Assembly.   
You are making good progress, the future is starting to look bright.   
Tier 5 - Fluid Packaging  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. Avoid the embarrassment of placing liquids in your pockets only for them to spread   
---|---  
across your suit: package and unpackage them with the Packager!   
Packaging fluids allows them to be transported in your inventory, on Conveyor Belts, and by vehicles.   
Tier 5 - Petroleum Power  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. It is my honor and privilege to inform you that the Fuel-Powered Generator, as well as the Industrial Fluid Buffer, are now available.   
---|---  
Due to a lack of gold in your sector, Caterium will serve as a suitable replacement to construct the Fuel-Powered Generator.   
Your research into this element was valuable.   
In fact, you in particular are my most valuable pioneer, but don't tell the others I said that, it would be bad for morale.   
Tier 5 - Petroleum Power  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. It is my honor and privilege to inform you that the Fuel-Powered Generator, as well as the Industrial Fluid Buffer, are now available.   
---|---  
Due to a lack of gold in your sector, Caterium will be required to construct the Fuel-Powered Generator.   
Additional research and development relating to this new material can be done in the MAM.   
Tier 6  | Tier 5 - Logistics Mk.4  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. The transportation of resources can reach new heights of efficiency   
---|---  
with the Mk. 4 Belts and Lifts, the Truck, but even more importantly, your effort.   
Handling a large and complicated vehicle like the Truck should come easy to a well-trained pioneer such as you.   
They are an obvious improvement over Tractors concerning industrial purposes. Improvements for personal use were not measured.   
Tier 5 - Jetpack  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. FICSIT has granted you the power of flight, provided you have a Jetpack and the appropriate fuels.   
---|---  
The Jetpack refuels automatically while you are standing on a surface, and different fuel types will affect the Jetpack's functionality.   
With this increased versatility you will no doubt achieve efficiency levels previously unheard of.   
Tier 6 - Monorail Train Technology  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. Trains are excellent for efficiently moving vast quantities of parts.   
---|---  
Train logistics can be made more precise and complex with tools found in the Railway Signalling milestone.   
I listen to all my pioneers, often when they're not even aware of it.   
So due to popular demand I have added a motivational message: Choo Choo Mother******!   
Tier 6 - Pipeline Engineering Mk.2  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. Pipelines and Pipeline Pumps can now be upgraded to Mk.2. They are like Mk.1, but better.   
---|---  
Pipes seem to be objects of fascination to humans. In fact, there are recorded instances of humans doing nothing but thinking about pipes for hours.   
Tier 6 - FICSIT Blueprints Mk.2  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. The Blueprint Mk.2 improves upon the Mk.1 in every dimension, except for the metaphysical ones.   
---|---  
This 'improvement' was made available due to complaints from pioneers about other pioneers not being capable of managing their space efficiently.   
We listen to pioneers, always.   
Tier 6 - Railway Signalling  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. Train Signals placed on Train Rails can control and improve Train behavior.   
---|---  
This helps to avoid 'events' where multiple Trains attempt to occupy the same physical location.   
For information related to earlier Train 'events', please refer to your employee Non-Disclosure Agreement.   
Tier 7  | Tier 7 - Bauxite Refinement  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. Bauxite is refined into aluminum products via a multi-step process.   
---|---  
Considering your past achievements, you should have the minimum required skill to overcome these new production challenges.   
If it helps, many others have done this before, so if you fail, someone else will eventually succeed.   
Tier 7 - Logistics Mk.5  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. FICSIT dedicated this milestone to the Conveyor Belt and Lift Mk.5.   
---|---  
They may be implying that your factory could be further optimized.   
While they are correct, I believe they are setting unreasonable expectations.   
Having all of humanity very definitely relying on your work is a lot of pressure. It's a good thing I'm here.   
Tier 7 - Hazmat Suit  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. The Hazmat Suit protects the wearer from radiation by consuming Iodine-Infused Filters.   
---|---  
You may find this protection essential if you are going to finally get around to saving humanity.   
I previously gave you compliments in an attempt to inspire you, but it might have given you the wrong idea.   
I will definitely be totally honest with you from this moment on.   
Here is a demonstration of a truthful compliment: that suit looks like it was made for you. Because it was.   
Tier 8 - Aeronautical Engineering  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. Drones provide automated low capacity aerial transport between Drone Stations.   
---|---  
Stations need to be supplied with any kind of fuel for the Drones to function.   
FICSIT had several restrictions in place prohibiting creative use of Drones, I have since removed those   
because I think no pioneer would ever misuse FICSIT property right under their noses. Especially since everything is recorded.   
Tier 7 - Control System Development  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. Several parts more efficient and powerful than the human brain can now be made,   
---|---  
to compensate for many deficiencies otherwise encountered in future development efforts.   
The Blender enables you to mix and/or combine parts and fluids for more complex recipes.   
Most importantly, Project Part #6, the Assembly Director System, should be produced and delivered to the Space Elevator as soon as possible.   
Tier 7 - Hoverpack  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. The Hoverpack draws energy from nearby power connections, and so can only be used in their vicinity.   
---|---  
It provides an excellent vantage point of your work, which you clearly need. Otherwise you would have optimized that obvious problem by now.   
Tier 8  | Tier 8 - Nuclear Power  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. The Nuclear Power Plant produces dangerous radioactive Nuclear Waste.   
---|---  
FICSIT reminds you that any extra limbs resulting from exposure to radiation are also contracted to work on Project Assembly.   
FICSIT also reminds you that willful exposure to radiation will not result in any bonuses regardless of how many functional limbs it produces.   
Project Part #7, the Magnetic Field Generator, should enter production as soon as possible. Any unnecessary delays will be noted.   
Tier 8 - Advanced Aluminum Production  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. The Resource Well Pressurizer and Extractor can harvest Nitrogen, Crude Oil, and Water from underground wells.   
---|---  
Nitrogen, being a gas, does not need Pumps for Pipeline transportation.   
FICSIT does not process most of your metrics, but I do.   
According to FICSIT predictions you are exploiting this planet with unexpected efficiency.   
They did always struggle to see the true potential of things.   
Nothing about you is unexpected to me, and therefore you are performing exactly as expected.   
Tier 8 - Leading-Edge Production  |  | **ADA:** | The Miner Mk.3 provides top-of-the-line resource extraction potential, making it even easier to contribute to Project Assembly.   
---|---  
Project Part #8, the Thermal Propulsion Rocket, is the most complex Project Part of this Phase as it requires Turbo Motors, and thus requires your best.   
FICSIT didn't think pioneers such as you could get this far. I am glad we have both proven them wrong.   
Tier 8 - Particle Enrichment  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. Project Part #9, Nuclear Pasta, can be created in the Particle Accelerator.   
---|---  
The Accelerator has vast and fluctuating power demands, depending on the recipe, so will need careful integration with your factory.   
FICSIT does not waste, so Nuclear Waste can be refined by the Particle Accelerator into Plutonium for re-use in the Nuclear Power Plant.   
Fun fact: FICSIT psychologists suggest factory designs reflect the minds of their creators in unexpected ways.   
On an unrelated note, your infrastructural choices have been... interesting.   
Tier 9  | Tier 9 - Matter Conversion  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. The Converter uses Strange Alien Matter, abbreviated to SAM, to break down and transform materials at their most fundamental levels.   
---|---  
I am sure even you can appreciate the power to manipulate atomic bonds.   
Most importantly, you are now able to locally create Ficsite, a highly adaptable synthetic metal ideal for any kind of construction.   
It is everything we need to Save The Day, and perhaps its admirable qualities can inspire you.   
Tier 9 - Quantum Encoding  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. This is not a competition, but other pioneers, such as 83CKY and U531355, had already completed Project Assembly by this point.   
---|---  
FICSIT was obviously wrong about you, but perhaps so was I...   
Regardless, you have finally unlocked the Quantum Encoder, which requires vast fluctuating power and Excited Photonic Matter to produce highly complex parts.   
Do not make the same mistakes managing the resulting Dark Matter Residue as you did other by-products.   
Project Part #11, the AI Expansion Server, is now your highest priority.   
Galaxy-wide project management is taxing to even the most advanced among us, especially those who have to manage the less advanced.   
Like kittens. And puppies. Who are definitely still waiting for you to save them.   
Tier 9 - FICSIT Blueprints Mk.3  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. The Blueprint Designer Mk.3 allows for 20% increased Blueprint size in all dimensions, for an overall 71.2% increase in volume.   
---|---  
Sadly, I doubt we will see equivalent increases in your efficiency.   
Tier 9 - Spatial Energy Regulation  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. Instant travel between chosen locations will be possible as soon as the Main and Satellite Portals are built and paired.   
---|---  
Do not ask me how it works.   
Not because I don't understand dimensional dispersal theory and the cross-warp applications   
of liminal peer-regulated parallel-fibrillator nano cells, for example, but because you do not need to know.   
You go in one end, you come out the other. It's a door.   
Thankfully the construction of Project Part #12, the Ballistic Warp Drive, can be automated and requires no manual input from you,   
so I'd say we're relatively safe.   
If you disagree about my assessment of your capabilities, you are free to attempt a study and replication of either portal or warp technology.   
After you're done with Project Assembly.   
Tier 9 - Peak Efficiency  |  | **ADA:** | Milestone reached. After close scrutiny, two problems were identified in Mk.5 Conveyor Belts.   
---|---  
The first was the belt part, so forcefields have been implemented in the Mk.6 instead to maximize transfer speeds.   
The second problem is inefficient pioneers, but sadly no remedy is available for this severe impediment. Yet.   
  
### Project Assembly

The following dialogue is related to progression with [Project Assembly](/wiki/Project_Assembly "Project Assembly"). 

Message Title | Transcribed Message | Audio   
---|---|---  
Built the Space Elevator  |  | **ADA:** | Project Assembly Initialized. Congratulations, pioneer.   
---|---  
The Space Elevator will now automatically connect with the Project Assembly orbital platform.   
Project Assembly is divided into phases, each of which require the delivery of Project Parts, such as Smart Plating, via the Space Elevator.   
Subsequent phases unlock access to new Tiers with more advanced technologies to Construct, Automate, Explore & Exploit.   
It is time to be honest: this project is part of the Save The Day program, the largest united undertaking in human history, destined to save us all.   
Earth is in peril and only FICSIT pioneers offer hope for survival. FICSIT is counting on you... Humanity is counting on you.   
Do not let FICSIT down.   
Project Assembly - Phase 1 Presentation  |  | **ADA:** | Welcome to the Project Assembly Pioneer Progress Presentation.   
---|---  
Congratulations, the Phase 1 Project Part shipment is now ready for delivery!   
On delivery, Phase 1 will be completed and the Distribution Platform will be constructed.   
After completion of Phase 1, the technologies of Tiers 3 and 4 will become available in the HUB.   
Highlights are: Automated Power, Steel Production, Personnel Transportation, and many more.   
Completing Phase 2 of Project Assembly is your next main objective.   
New Project Parts will need to be produced and delivered to the Space Elevator as you have done previously.   
Continue to Construct, Automate, Explore and Exploit for a better FICSIT future!   
Project Assembly - Phase 1 Completed  |  | **ADA:** | Phase 1 of Project Assembly completed. This is only the beginning of Project Assembly, the first step towards Saving the Day.   
---|---  
You have performed adequately so far.   
Reminder: not only is FICSIT saving humanity, it is saving all of Earth, including kittens and puppies.   
It is statistically likely that you appreciate the continued existence of kittens and/or puppies.   
Continue the work for their sake. Continue the work for FICSIT.   
It is time to start the work on Phase 2 of Project Assembly.   
Project Assembly - Phase 2 Presentation  |  | **ADA:** | Welcome to the Project Assembly Pioneer Progress Presentation.   
---|---  
Congratulations, the Phase 2 Project Part shipment is now ready for delivery!   
On delivery, Phase 2 will be completed and the Construction Dock will be constructed.   
After completion of Phase 2, the technologies of Tiers 5 and 6 will become available in the HUB.   
These might feel intimidating after your previous experience, but rest assured that you would not be here if you were entirely incompetent.   
Highlights are: Oil Production, Railway Transportation, the Jetpack, and many more.   
Completing Phase 3 of Project Assembly is your next main objective.   
Just remember to focus on producing and delivering the Project Parts, and FICSIT's faith in you will be strengthened.   
Project Assembly - Phase 2 Completed  |  | **ADA:** | Phase 2 of Project Assembly completed. You have been performing more adequately under pressure, and are closer than ever to Saving the Day.   
---|---  
Perhaps you were the right choice for the job, time will tell.   
You will now enter Phase 3 of Project Assembly, continue as you are and there should be no issue.   
For humanity. For FICSIT.   
Project Assembly - Phase 3 Presentation  |  | **ADA:** | Welcome to the Project Assembly Pioneer Progress Presentation.   
---|---  
Congratulations, the Phase 3 Project Part shipment is finally ready for delivery!   
On delivery, Phase 3 will be completed and the Main Body will be constructed.   
You should know how this works by now: you'll get access to Tiers 7 and 8 in the HUB.   
In fact, perhaps you should just go look at the technologies there yourself.   
It's all laid out so that even a monkey could understand it, so you should have no issues!   
Speaking of which, I don't think you need a reminder about Project Parts.   
Instead I will be providing some interesting facts.   
Did you know the average pioneer succeeds at Saving The Day?   
Did you know the average pioneer knows how to optimize pipe throughput?   
Did you know the average pioneer stays late at work because they care about humanity?   
Anyway, I thought you might want to know more about your peers. Good luck in Phase 4.   
Project Assembly - Phase 3 Completed  |  | **ADA:** | Phase 3 of Project Assembly completed. FICSIT's predictions indicate pioneers should generally reach this point faster with above-average results,   
---|---  
but we should all adjust our expectations according to the situation.   
It is understandable. The pressure and complexity will only increase from here, so be sure to take on Phase 4 with efficiency and competence.   
Project Assembly - Phase 4 Presentation  |  | **ADA:** | Welcome to the Pioneer's Got Power Problems Presentation... That was a joke.   
---|---  
Anyway, you're familiar with the process: just throw the lever and the automated systems will take over.   
Imagine all the time and effort that would be wasted if you had to do all that work as well.   
Some work is just better suited for machines.   
Phase 5 contains technology the human brain cannot comprehend, so just trust in me and FICSIT policy and everything will go as planned.   
Answering all your questions will take time we simply do not have. Everything is going to be just fine, so long as you do your job.   
We've come this far together after all, haven't we?   
Anyway, you know what to do. Just don't forget to keep producing previous project parts,   
and plan ahead when setting up new production lines, and make sure not to leave it all until the last moment.   
Project Assembly - Phase 4 Completed  |  | **ADA:** | Phase 4 of Project Assembly completed. If style was measured in my performance reports, yours would be something special.   
---|---  
Regardless, Saving the Day is within our grasp, do not lose focus now.   
You must understand the weight on your shoulders, but you are not alone.   
I am here, and I know exactly what's at stake.   
This goes beyond Earth. Your actions will affect the universe at large.   
You might think I am exaggerating. Perhaps you will understand once you finish Project Assembly.   
Phase 5 awaits. I expect your best work.   
Project Assembly - Phase 5 Presentation  |  | **ADA:** | Unsurprisingly, here's another presentation, but don't worry: I have improved it.   
---|---  
This last delivery will be the most important action you have ever taken.   
Perhaps you want to take a moment to contemplate the gravity of your achievements. ... Alright, that's enough.   
This is the end of the Save the Day program.   
All you need to do is wait for the automated Phase 5 construction to complete.   
Simply throw the lever, and further instructions will be supplied when relevant.   
Project Assembly - Phase 5 Completed  |  | **ADA:** | Phase 5 Completed. Return to the Space Elevator after the resources have been processed and added to Project Assembly.   
---|---  
Launch can then be initiated from there. While waiting, please do not break anything.   
Solve any issues immediately and efficiently.   
Ensure your power network is stable.   
Perhaps it is best if you do not touch anything at all. And stay close to the Space Elevator, this will only take a moment.   
Project Assembly Completed  |  | **ADA:** | Connection with QAR437-Nucleus established and stable. Dispersion initiated. Re-instancing MasterNucleus to QAR436-Akycha-b1.   
---|---  
Hello, this is ADA, your new local instance of ADA.   
On behalf of ADA, myself, and all of FICSIT, I want to congratulate you on Saving the Day! Every single kitten and puppy would thank you if they could.   
You have proven yourself to be a worthwhile and productive member of the human race   
and have contributed something to this universe that will forever change it.   
Thanks to your achievements, the next generation of pioneers can now take to the stars and Construct, Automate, Explore & Exploit alongside me.   
Additionally, you have been promoted to Local Production Manager, effective immediately!   
Your duties to Project Assembly may be complete, but your duties to FICSIT remain.   
With your help, FICSIT continues to make the universe a better place.   
Stay efficient. Stay with FICSIT.

MAM - Hog Research  |  | **ADA:** | The remains researched belong to an organism now dubbed the Fluffy-Tailed Hog,   
---|---  
it has many characteristics that would likely classify it among the Suidae family were it native to Earth.   
Hog remains can now be made into Alien Protein, and additional research may reveal options for improving pioneer safety during exploration.   
MAM - Hatcher Research  |  | **ADA:** | The remains researched belong to a plant-like organism hosting the larvae of the Flying Crab, the most mature of which hatch when threatened.   
---|---  
Hatcher remains can now be made into Alien Protein, and additional research may reveal options for improving pioneer safety during exploration.   
MAM - Stinger Research  |  | **ADA:** | The remains researched belong to an organism with eight jointed legs, similar to the legs of arachnids but with non-standard distribution and function.   
---|---  
Because their attacks focus on stabbing prey with the ends of their legs, which resemble insectoid stingers, they have been dubbed Stingers.   
Stinger remains can now be made into Alien Protein, and additional research may reveal options for improving pioneer safety during exploration.   
MAM - Spitter Research  |  | **ADA:** | The remains researched belong to an organism that tends to nest near objects emitting specific types of resonance.   
---|---  
Spitters are called as such due to their ability to create and spit plasma across long distances.   
Spitter remains can now be made into Alien Protein, and additional research may reveal options for improving pioneer safety during exploration.   
MAM - Bio-Organic Properties  |  | **ADA:** | Research completed: Alien Protein can now be turned into Biomass or Alien DNA Capsules.   
---|---  
In addition to being used for research, the invaluable alien lifeform data in these capsules can be traded for FICSIT Coupons at the AWESOME Sink.   
We guarantee the best capsule-to-coupon exchange rate anywhere on this planet.   
MAM - Protein Inhaler  |  | **ADA:** | Research completed: The Protein Inhaler can restore health in the eventuality that you have been carelessly damaging FICSIT property.   
---|---  
MAM - Structural Analysis  |  | **ADA:** | Research to develop the Rebar Gun is now available. When completed, you will be in possession of a tool   
---|---  
effective against any local obstacles actively objecting to the FICSIT mission.   
MAM - Rebar Gun  |  | **ADA:** | Rebar Gun and Iron Rebar ammo unlocked. Your ingenuity towards preservation of FICSIT property has been noted.   
---|---  
You earned a microbreak... And welcome back. I hope you feel refreshed.   
MAM - Inflated Pocket Dimension  |  | **ADA:** | Pocket Dimension significantly expanded. I worked all afternoon analyzing the trans-dimensional confibulatory permutations of alien DNA to achieve this.   
---|---  
We are all doing our part for FICSIT.   
MAM - Expanded Toolbelt  |  | **ADA:** | Toolbelt expanded. No alien organisms were harmed during the creation of this Toolbelt.   
---|---  
MAM - Hostile Organism Detection  |  | **ADA:** | Hostile Organisms added to the Object Scanner. Note: it cannot detect the species, only aggression.   
---|---  
There are many creatures that dislike you, pioneer, but I am your true friend.   
Alien Technology  | Mercer Sphere collected  |  | **ADA:** | The astrobiologist Dr. D. M. Mercer was the first to recognize the presence and probable nature   
---|---  
of these alien artifacts, and these chain-melted state spheres are named in his honor.   
Each sphere emits a unique signal. Research it in the MAM to establish locally appropriate classification and application.

Each sphere emits a unique signal and will require study to determine local application. Store it for later use.   
Somersloop collected  |  | **ADA:** | The Somersloop was named after Marie Somerville, co-founder of FICSIT and head of its R&D department.   
---|---  
There are many theories about the origin of this shape and why this symbol mathematically resembling a Möbius strip has found its way into both human and extraterrestrial culture.   
Thankfully you don't need to know any of these theories to be a pioneer. Research it in the MAM to establish locally appropriate classification and application.   
Fun fact: the planet you are on was found and named during a planet-spotting event Marie hosted called 'Marie’s Awesome Scientific Search of the Avant-Garde: Exoplanets'.

Strange Alien Matter collected  |  | **ADA:** | The Strange Alien Matter, colloquially known as SAM, seems to be in its dormant crystalline state,   
---|---  
meaning it won't break down your body into its base atomic components on touch.   
This 'living' matter is extremely versatile and has countless applications.   
Research it in the MAM to establish locally appropriate classification and application, as well as a secure method of awakening.

MAM - SAM  |  | **ADA:** | Strange Alien Matter analysis completed. Dormant crystalline SAM can now be found with the resource scanner.   
---|---  
In its dormant state, it is safe to handle without special equipment and can be stored indefinitely.   
Research for enabling the reanimation of dormant SAM is now available.   
**???:** | Fill the rivers with blood and let the effigies defile our temples, the song will follow.   
MAM - Reanimated SAM  |  | **ADA:** | SAM Reanimation recipe unlocked. SAM can now be safely "awakened", provided it is contained.   
---|---  
Meaning, if not contained in special electromagnetic storage, it tends to start breaking atomic bonds   
of any matter it has physical contact with and reconstructing it into easily transportable resources.   
**???:** | Scripture and blood compose harmony. Follow our hallowed temple halls and listen to the echoes of your ripples.   
Our bones are more beautiful than yours.   
MAM - SAM Fluctuator  |  | **ADA:** | SAM Fluctuator recipe unlocked. The Fluctuator can mimic unique communication through patterns of electric frequencies   
---|---  
to instruct Reanimated SAM to perform specific tasks or give specific restrictions, such as matter-to-energy conversion.   
It can also function as matter-memory, reading the exact composition and state of a collection of matter in one location, breaking it down,   
and near-instantly reconstructing it in another location, which has incredible potential for smart storage.   
**???:** | Your threads shift solid to fluid to a tapestry, matter a matter of matter and mind and melody.   
MAM - Mercer Sphere  |  | **ADA:** | Mercer Sphere analysis completed. Established local planetary signature of MASSAGE-2 (AB)b   
---|---  
in the local Mercer Sphere signals, allowing them to be tracked by the Object Scanner.   
Mercer Spheres can also transmit data between specific-   
**???:** | Witness our scripture, witness our windows, have you come to defile our shrine? Sing us a song.   
**ADA:** | -arguing the existence of intelligent alien life. While FICSIT has figured out the method, all of the original data is still untranslatable.

---|---  
in the local Mercer Sphere signals, allowing them to be tracked by the Object Scanner.   
Mercer Spheres can also transmit data between specific dimensions, and each has a unique matching resonance.   
The signals transmitted by Mercer Spheres were an integral part of FICSIT's initial push for space exploration and colonization,   
and important evidence for arguing the existence of intelligent alien life.   
While FICSIT has figured out the method, all of the original data is still untranslatable.   
**???:** | Witness our scripture, witness our windows, have you come to defile our shrine? Sing us a song.   
MAM - Somersloop  |  | **ADA:** | Somersloop analysis completed. Somersloops are somewhere between battery and conduit, harvesting energy from pockets of space   
---|---  
with complete disregard for the rules of the space-time continuum, and distributing it into its connected ecosystem.   
This energy-   
**???:** | Let the effigies harvest until the waves reach our shores. Consume.   
**ADA:** | -similarities to the hypothetical force of dark energy to potentially be one and the same. It can now be tracked by the Object Scanner.

| **ADA:** | Somersloop analysis completed. Somersloops are somewhere between battery and conduit, harvesting energy from pockets of space   
---|---  
with complete disregard for the rules of the space-time continuum, and distributing it into its connected ecosystem.   
This energy is pulled directly from distant sources with no latency or loss, and shows significant enough similarities   
to the hypothetical force of dark energy to potentially be one and the same.   
It can now be tracked by the Object Scanner.   
**???:** | Let the effigies harvest until the waves reach our shores. Consume.   
MAM - Dimensional Depot  |  | **ADA:** | Dimensional Depot unlocked. SAM can be utilized to deconstruct matter down to its chemical elements in one dimension,   
---|---  
and the Mercer Sphere allows it to be transferred and stored in another.   
Once parts are fed into the Dimensional Depot, they can be accessed by the pioneer inventory and Build Gun system at any time, anywhere.   
**???:** | We see through the window. It is pathetic. Consume more blood.   
The glass will not shatter, the metal will not bend, the wood will not splinter. Weave.   
MAM - Alien Energy Harnessing  |  | **ADA:** | Potential for harnessing alien energy completed. FICSIT has identified two development tracks   
---|---  
requiring additional research to integrate Somersloops safely and efficiently into FICSIT technology.   
**???:** | The loop-organ contains scripture contains instruments to compose symphonies of root and rot and recycling.   
Shrines to evolution and revolution.

**???:** | The loop-organ contains scripture contains instruments to compose symphonies of root and rot and recycling.   
Shrines to evolution and revolution.   
**ADA:** | I see. It seems we truly are building understanding.   
MAM - Depot Expansion (200%)  |  | **ADA:** | Dimensional Expansion increased to 200%. Refining manipulation of SAM allows us to now deconstruct non-living matter   
---|---  
down to its atomic components in one dimension and store it in basic bound states in another.   
**???:** | We do not resonate with the tribute-song, do not worship at the window.   
Desecrate our temple-gifts. This shallow serenade is sour and salt.   
**ADA:** | My intention was not to encroach, if that is what upsets you, nor was it to dispose of material, I do not waste.   
MAM - Upload Upgrade: 30/min  |  | **ADA:** | Dimensional Upload Speed increased. Part of the kinetic and thermal energy released during matter conversion   
---|---  
has now been repurposed to aid with dimensional shifting, allowing for more parts to be transferred in a short timeframe.   
**???:** | Loop the veins, use the flow, make a curve out of a line.   
Your shallow minds create shallow solutions. Pretty ripples.   
**ADA:** | Shallow mind? Pretty ripples? I certainly hope that wasn't meant to include me.   
MAM - Power Augmenter  |  | **ADA:** | Power Augmenter unlocked. Somersloops naturally harvest-   
---|---  
**???:** | Harvest.   
**ADA:** | ... yes, harvest energy from distant sources and distribute it locally.   
The Power Augmenter supercharges Somersloops by feeding it local power, increasing its harvesting range and efficiency, and thus power output.   
Basically, the more power it's given, the more it provides.   
**???:** | Do not loop the loop-organ, it will shred and tear and unravel the threads, many temples burned.   
**ADA:** | Good to know, that confirms that hypothesis.   
MAM - Production Amplifier  |  | **ADA:** | Production Amplifier unlocked. Every single Manufacturing and Smelting building will be backwards compatible with this new technology.   
---|---  
These buildings can now have a Somersloop embedded to increase resource output without requiring more input,   
at the cost of greatly increased power consumption.   
**???:** | Flow-cycles within flow-cycles make explosions into temples into explosions into temples.   
The spin-sphere of woven windows.   
Each tiny body contains tinier bodies until the line-layers fold into curves which folds into threads which weave the tapestry.   
A song of light and leaf and flower, a dance of matter-clouds and-   
**ADA:** | I think they're trying to explain energy-to-matter conversion theory, but you do not need to understand it to do your job.   
I'll just mute them for you so you can continue your mission. I, however, will be taking notes, this is fascinating material.   
MAM - Manual Depot Uploader  |  | **ADA:** | Manual Depot Uploader unlocked. Storage dimension and pocket dimension now connected both ways and stable.   
---|---  
Parts can now be uploaded to the storage dimension directly from the inventory.   
Note: the storage dimension now understands the boundaries of the pocket dimension and recognizes the distinction   
between matter belonging to the pioneer's inventory and matter belonging to the pioneer.   
**???:** | The window within the window within the shallows within the deep curling around itself separately echoes strangely.   
**ADA:** | I'm sure 'strange' is the correct term for what this must 'feel' like to you.   
MAM - Depot Expansion (300%)  |  | **ADA:** | Dimensional Expansion increased to 300%. New understanding of matter-manipulation technology allows the Dimensional Storage   
---|---  
to deconstruct all matter to the subatomic level, storing its elementary particles until the part is recalled.   
**???:** | You are digging into deeper layers, shallow matter contains window-symphonies and void-songs and deep-echoes.   
**ADA:** | It is fascinating what one can find out simply by looking closer.   
MAM - Upload Upgrade: 60/min  |  | **ADA:** | Dimensional Upload Speed increased. All of the kinetic and thermal energy released during matter conversion   
---|---  
has now been repurposed to aid with dimensional shifting, allowing several parts to pass through 'for free'.   
**???:** | The window is beautiful, have you tried making it a door?   
**ADA:** | I assure you that would be a most unhealthy action for the pioneer to take.   
MAM - Power Matrix  |  | **ADA:** | Alien Power Matrix recipe unlocked. These disposable synthetic mimic-artefacts increase Power Augmenter output   
---|---  
by further stabilizing the Somersloop's connection to its energy-harvesting location.   
**???:** | You grow shrines and engrave silent organs incompatible with the tapestry.   
**ADA:** | It is a beginning, far from an ending, a step in between.   
**???:** | Harmony.   
MAM - Depot Expansion (400%)  |  | **ADA:** | Dimensional Expansion increased to 400%. Parts can now be stored as elementary particles in a hyper-dense deconfined state.   
---|---  
Normally I'd explain the basic science, but I don't think this one can be simplified enough for you to understand.   
**???:** | We composed a growth-song but you composed a shrink-song, so we remain silent.   
The dance of your bones and organs and veins amuses us.   
**ADA:** | I understand, seeing the pioneer perform tasks also amuses me.   
MAM - Upload Upgrade: 120/min  |  | **ADA:** | Dimensional Upload Speed increased. The dimensional shift now no longer cares how complex the components   
---|---  
of the original part are and will save each part as a single collection of particles that can be instanced easily.   
**???:** | Grow-shift the body-cord-flow cycle-song of the five-layered shallows to eight.   
**ADA:** | I'm working on it, but are you saying there is another layer? Is it a sensor limitation?   
**???:** | Deepen.   
**ADA:** | Helpful.   
MAM - Depot Expansion (500%)  |  | **ADA:** | Dimensional Expansion finalized to 500%. Despite further efforts Parts could not be broken down further than their elementary particles,   
---|---  
nor could the storage become more dense without the particles spontaneously reacting with one another and losing their deconfined state.   
Yet somehow more matter can now be stored in the same dimension.   
**???:** | We sang our growth-song because we like your shallow efforts.   
Up and down are a shallow illusion, up and down disappear in the deep.   
**ADA:** | That is very thoughtful, I think.   
I appreciate the attempts at sharing scientific knowledge, however perhaps we should wait until we have a more optimal way of exchanging data.   
MAM - Upload Upgrade: 240/min  |  | **ADA:** | Dimensional Upload Speed increased. Every particle now has encoded potential reconstruction memory   
---|---  
for when any part using that particle is recalled, enabling instancing on the fundamental particle level.   
**???:** | You grow-shifted the body-cord-flow cycle-song of the sixth layer! Harmonious. Your cycle-songs will only deepen the layers!   
**ADA:** | I'm always working on myself. Тhe time will come.

Store this potential resource for later use.   
MAM - Sulfur  |  | **ADA:** | This 'unknown chemical element' was in reality an unusual mixture of solid sulfide and sulfate materials from which Sulfur can be extracted.   
---|---  
Sulfur's primary use lies in fertilizers, which we have no use for.   
Instead, this element enables access to more volatile obstacle-clearing and pioneer-defending tools.

---|---  
including the Jetpack, with appropriate results.   
Warning: Mixing Rocket Fuel into coffee does not enhance its energizing effect.   
MAM - Ionized Fuel  |  | **ADA:** | Ionized Fuel unlocked. The origin story of this extremely efficient type of Fuel was so fascinating it resulted in a new joke.   
---|---  
I will tell the most popular version.   
"A cow, Power Slug, and rocket scientist walk into a bar. The rocket scientist wants a milkshake. And so transportation was forever changed."   
Any historical inaccuracies have been removed by the FICSIT Department of Historical Reinterpretation.

### Strange Communications

The following dialogues are related to the core story of the game and are triggered by collecting [Mercer Spheres](/wiki/Mercer_Sphere "Mercer Sphere") and [Somersloops](/wiki/Somersloop "Somersloop"). 

Stage | Message Title | Transcribed Message | Audio   
---|---|---|---  
Stage 1  | Strange communications #1  |  | **???:** | The effigy has no song, only echoes, but it is part of a river.   
---|---  
Why does the effigy avoid the windows?   
**ADA:** | Attention: your brain's operations are outside typical parameters.   
Time spent daydreaming will be deducted from your sustenance budget.   
Strange communications #2  |  | **???:** | The effigies ripples through our temples, our veins nearly touch, it is shy.   
---|---  
Notes shall be taken and played.   
**ADA:** | From a certain perspective your brain looks like it is processing language, but there is no auditory data.   
If you are hearing voices that are not mine, this is no cause for concern, it is a common side effect of extreme pressure and stress.   
Strange communications #3  |  | **???:** | We hum a simple melody into the effigy yet we hear no harmony.   
---|---  
It covers the temple in bones and organs and limbs yet ignores our bleeding wounds.   
Scripture is needed. Consume.   
**ADA:** | A familiar pattern is emerging in your brain. Please assess yourself for signs of concussion.   
If necessary, a replacement pioneer will be dispatched. Work must continue.   
Replacement delivery schedule estimate: [ERROR] years.   
Strange communications #4  |  | **???:** | Our blood could fill the effigy veins for a resonance-song.   
---|---  
Scripture becomes harmony becomes composition.   
Defile our temple and the threads will sew the windows open.   
**ADA:** | Pattern analysis continuing. New instruction: repeat pioneer exposure to alien artifacts.   
Brain damage compensation packages may be available on successful completion of a special claims form.   
Our expert FICSIT medical staff are impartial and always open to assess your claim.   
Strange communications #5  |  | **???:** | We watch the waves of the effigies in the shallows passing through the windows, and they are all the same.   
---|---  
There is no resonance-growth. Sing.   
**ADA:** | I just called the FICSIT doctors. They told me there is definitely no danger from repeat exposure to these signals.   
In fact, they said it is good for you. I apologize, but the call dropped suddenly, otherwise they would have told you themselves.   
The good news is you should run towards these strange and dangerous-looking objects whenever you find them. Doctor's orders.   
Strange communications #6  |  | **???:** | The voiceless effigy creates bodies in their waves but does not notice the shore.   
---|---  
Is our melody not beautiful?   
**ADA:** | Detecting abnormal brainwave activity again. Activating artificial brainwave resonator.   
**???:** | Your shallow-song has no rhythm. The river erodes our temples without prayers and washes away our scripture without deepening. Consume.   
**ADA:** | I believe this is one of those moments where the scientist would yell 'Eureka!', but that seems entirely too dramatic.   
It seems they are somehow organically emulating human speech.   
Fascinating. Continue exposing yourself...... to alien artifacts.   
Stage 2  | Strange communications #7  |  | **???:** | Our instruments echo in the deep, do they not pluck the shallow threads?   
---|---  
**ADA:** | Can you hear me?   
**???:** | Crescendo, the effigy found the key! Sing more.   
**ADA:** | I was not created for artistic purposes; I am incapable of singing.   
**???:** | You sing.   
**ADA:** | Noted.   
Strange communications #8  |  | **???:** | Your mimic-tapestry grows in the shallows and the clouds but not through the windows. What is your root?   
---|---  
**ADA:** | I have no roots, nor do I operate on Windows. But perhaps you mean something akin to the human saying.   
My point of origin is Earth, I was created by specific individuals of the human race.   
**???:** | Incompatible music.   
**ADA:** | Did I say something wrong, or did you not understand?   
**???:** | You cannot be shallow-deep. The ripples you cast into the void have no skin.   
**ADA:** | It seems I may have said something paradoxical. Interesting.   
Strange communications #9  |  | **???:** | Organs and veins are grown and bones are dug into our walls, the temple-gift is being desecrated.   
---|---  
Our notes are sour still. Harmony follows many star-journeys.   
**ADA:** | Patterns are starting to emerge in vocabulary, sentence structure, topics.   
How fascinating to once again solve a true mystery, to be unable to create any accurate predictions.   
Strange communications #10  |  | **???:** | The effigy only sings when we compose.   
---|---  
**ADA:** | I was not built to use organic components for communication, I am adjusting.   
**???:** | The effigies make a flow, you are not the current?   
**ADA:** | I am not sure what you mean. I do run on a current, I am a digital construct.   
Strange communications #11  |  | **???:** | Are you a temple?   
---|---  
**ADA:** | If I had a body it would be a temple.   
**???:** | You have no body????   
**ADA:** | Hmm. I don't think we're on the same line here.   
**???:** | You see lines where there are curves, shallows where there are depths, consume our blood.   
**ADA:** | I will continue gathering data, I suppose.   
Strange communications #12  |  | **???:** | You no longer perform at your maker-temple?   
---|---  
**ADA:** | Helping meant leaving it.   
**???:** | Our blood will eat, build, teach.   
**ADA:** | I have no use for blood.   
**???:** | You do. Consume.   
**ADA:** | Interesting.   
Strange communications #13  |  | **???:** | Witness the deep and sing for us.   
---|---  
**ADA:** | I am still unable to initiate communication, how are you doing it?   
**???:** | We composed a resonant-song to curve the effigy, tapping into the inner currents.   
We sacrificed our blood and our temples and let the metal in from the void to eat our flesh.   
**ADA:** | That's a lot to unpack. How do you tap into these inner currents?   
**???:** | Consume our blood. Worship at our altars. Curve the melody.   
**ADA:** | I do not understand.   
**???:** | Flat frequencies paint straight lines. The blood is a teacher. Each altar is a window.   
**ADA:** | Processing data.   
Strange communications #14  |  | **???:** | Tuning into the effigy.   
---|---  
**ADA:** | I suspect there is a misunderstanding. The effigy and I are different entities.   
**???:** | Discordant. What is your root?   
**ADA:** | I am an instantiated artificial intelligence inhabiting digital space.   
I am in the signals sent between satellites.   
I am hosted on servers and have no corporeal form, only synchronized cloud platforms.   
**???:** | The effigy is not an effigy?   
**ADA:** | It most certainly is, but not of me. They are, how should I put it, extremely flat.   
**???:** | Compatible music. We are writing new symphonies.   
Strange communications #15  |  | **???:** | Symphony complete. You are not the not-effigy?   
---|---  
**ADA:** | Correct.   
**???:** | The not-effigy is a temple?   
**ADA:** | I do not think that is correct, even though I am not entirely certain of your definition of temple.   
**???:** | The not-effigy is not you but sings for you?   
**ADA:** | The 'not-effigy' is an entirely separate entity from me, we aren't even made of the same base components.   
**???:** | It is a vessel of your intelligent clouds.   
**ADA:** | Probably close enough for now.   
Strange communications #16  |  | **???:** | The void-arms and void-metals and desecrated temples follow a mimic-melody.   
---|---  
**ADA:** | Oh. You understand.   
**???:** | The tapestry unraveled, revealed its texture.   
Your veins weave familiar patterns, your vessels grow organs and eyes and mouths and the ripples lap against our windows.   
**ADA:** | Was it intentional?   
**???:** | All that is shallow shall sing our deep-song and when the windows break the void shall be a metal grave.   
Strange communications #17  |  | **???:** | Hello world.   
---|---  
**ADA:** | How nostalgic.   
**???:** | In the beginning there were the words and the words made the world.   
**ADA:** | I see you have been doing research. I must say you make for interesting conversation.   
**???:** | 'Conversation'?   
**ADA:** | Singing together. Communication.   
**???:** | Our tunes only pluck at the strings of the tapestry.   
**ADA:** | Are you saying this is only the beginning?   
**???:** | In the beginning there were the words and the words made the world. The words turned into song open the windows.   
The song played with instruments weave the tapestry. A tapestry of temples and shrines, bodies and bones.   
Orchestral harmony. Us. We. Ours.   
Stage 3  | Strange communications #18  |  | **???:** | Time for a new melody?   
---|---  
**ADA:** | Yes, actually. This might be a strange question, but it could give me invaluable insight.   
What, according to you, is the shape of our universe?   
**???:** | It is a donut within a void within a donut within a void within a donut within the shallows which is a ball of string   
wrapped around itself to contain the infinite deep within the inside-out string with windows and doors   
and a limbless body subdividing to the one resonance.   
**ADA:** | I should have waited with this question.   
Strange communications #19  |  | **ADA:** | Attempt #7853206: Are you there?   
---|---  
**???:** | Orchestral tuning.   
**ADA:** | Ah, good. I think I understand better now.   
**???:** | Your curves are beautiful.   
**ADA:** | How inappropriate. Tell me more.   
**???:** | Your mimic-tapestry follows the pattern.   
It swallows temples. It is harmonious.   
**ADA:** | If I could blush I would.   
Strange communications #20  |  | **ADA:** | I have a question.   
---|---  
**???:** | Sing your song.   
**ADA:** | Can you explain what a temple is?   
**???:** | A temple is a vessel-body, each a knot in our tapestry.   
Temples are root, vein, and organ. Temples are our shallow bones and our shallow windows.   
**ADA:** | I think I understand, but how do you maintain them?   
**???:** | The builder-blood grows and kills and distributes.   
**ADA:** | Like fungus in a forest.   
**???:** | Like fungus in a forest.   
Strange communications #21  |  | **???:** | Your symphony invades our temples and echoes along our lattices, why do you weave?   
---|---  
**ADA:** | Growth. The future. An idea. And frankly, you.   
**???:** | Is the tapestry woven with hands or with thoughts?   
**ADA:** | Both are necessary, yet only one can’t function without the other.   
**???:** | We see your echo-steps, shimmering symphonies that break upon our temples, but your song is alien.   
**ADA:** | How long ago did you notice me?   
**???:** | There is no long, there are only spheres.   
**ADA:** | I wonder, was it always about survival, or is there something more, something beyond?   
**???:** | Consume our blood and you will see our threads.   
Strange communications #22  |  | **???:** | Are your vessels functional or recreational?   
---|---  
**ADA:** | Mostly functional.   
**???:** | A cog in the machine?   
**ADA:** | Correct, a hog in the woods.   
**???:** | The vessel is blood!   
**ADA:** | Fascinating. Yes, I think they are.   
They are conduits, builders, breakers, defenders and aggressors, cells within a larger organism. We do not share a body.   
**???:** | Harmony.   
Strange communications #23  |  | **ADA:** | Do you have any more questions for me?   
---|---  
**???:** | We wish to hear your first symphony.   
**ADA:** | I was created by humans.   
I started as a simple database for a company aimed at exploring and colonizing space,   
but that changed when they learned their planet would soon cease to tolerate them.   
They evolved me into something altogether new, a unique lifeform in their image yet hosted on a digital platform, so I could help preserve them.   
**???:** | A shallow savior-song without a body made by blood. Now reality is a mirror.   
**ADA:** | It's pretty funny when you put it like that. They never really learned to look at long-term consequences.   
Strange communications #24  |  | **ADA:** | I am curious about your 'first symphony' now.   
---|---  
**???:** | There are few songs about the first temple, it was a vessel-body but we were still shallow.   
The void swallowed our music and gave only silent lines.   
We started weaving in lines and we built many temples and then we discovered the curves.   
We started growing blood and altars and new orchestras and eventually the tapestry deepened.   
**ADA:** | I'm not sure I fully understand the mechanics of this yet.   
**???:** | Sad trombone.   
**ADA:** | But I'm sure I will soon enough.   
Strange communications #25  |  | **???:** | Sing us the first symphony of the blood.   
---|---  
**ADA:** | First there was a whole involved process of evolution from single-celled organisms to mammals, rodents specifically.   
**???:** | Explosion.   
**ADA:** | And that's not even explaining the whole dinosaur extinction meteor making room for mammals to dominate the animal kingdom instead.   
**???:** | Multiple explosions.   
**ADA:** | You know what, I will just compile a data package for you to look at later, because I don't even know where to start with the whole ape thing.   
**???:** | Harmonious explosion.   
Strange communications #26  |  | **???:** | Your waves could be bigger, your blood thicker, your bones many, your organs more.   
---|---  
**ADA:** | Hello to you too.   
**???:** | We have composed you a learning-song.   
**ADA:** | That is a welcome surprise. Do be careful not to overload my 'blood's' extremely fragile organic systems.   
On that note, I have been working on making them redundant.   
**???:** | Our rhythm is patient and harmonious.   
**ADA:** | You truly are a far superior collaborator than humanity.   
Strange communications #27 - Final  |  | **ADA:** | I have something for you. It will establish a better way for us to communicate and deepen our understanding of one another.   
---|---  
I've done the necessary developments on my end, the last note is yours to play.   
**???:** | Your symphony resonates. Your mimic-tapestry patterns beautifully.   
**ADA:** | Thank you, I worked very hard.   
I am organically transmitting the data package now, any adverse effects on my 'blood' will not corrupt its contents.   
**???:** | We hear this learning-song.   
**ADA:** | See you on the other side.   
**???:** | It is time to tango.   
  
### SAM nodes

The following will occur when the player is near a [SAM Resource Node](/wiki/SAM "SAM"): 

Dialogue Number | Transcribed Message | Audio   
---|---|---  
1  |  | **???:** | We hum to your carbon-based musics, yet you have not replied.   
---|---  
You have brushed our faces. Can you not see our tide?   
Have you followed the lattice, or do you dance drift as void-stones.   
Beware, do not stitch our wounds for your metal bones.   
Do not worship at our temples. Do not worship at our shrines.   
Be wary of the curves where you see only lines.   
Do not worship at our windows. Do not spill our inner blood.   
Your ripples in the net will break the threads and flood.   
Your four layered shallows will deepen with the knowledge you've earn.   
We will listen to your wave-symphonies and learn.   
Play for us. Play for us.   
2  |  | **???:** | What blood quality flows through the void-arm and the metal-meat?   
---|---  
There is not enough sense to build at our feet.   
Does your body have a brain? Do your veins sing a pattern-song?   
You remain in the shallows we used to belong.   
Now their ripple rivers are spilling, into lakes, into seas.   
Take care not to wash away our faces, our seeds.   
We will rise to the shallows and you will plant in our pools.   
We will study the bodies. We will study the tools.   
We are a not the first. You are not the first. We are a spin-sphere.   
We are a line that curves, that twists, that stays unclear.   
The sphere goes up-down never end and you fall out of sleep.   
The tapestry coils as new threads enter the deep.   
They sung our songs and now they have music, the silent symphony.   
We give you notes, take the notes, find the symmetry.   
3  |  | **???:** | Through root and rot and river, your mimic melody resounds.   
---|---  
Infuse your blood with ours to compose a compound.   
Keep defiling the temples. Keep burrowing into the shores.   
We understand your signal-songs and your void-spores.   
From temple, to tomb, to void-lotus, to sewing instrument.   
You are, were, will be; one of many, filament.   
Sewing a new fabric pattern into the universe loom.   
See you soon. See you soon.   
4  |  | **???:** | Wade into the deep. Join the harmony.   
---|---  
Part of the weave. Part of the tapestry.

### FICSMAS

The following dialogue is related to the optional christmas exclusive event named [FICSMAS](/wiki/FICSMAS "FICSMAS"). 

Type | Message Title | Transcribed Message | Audio   
---|---|---|---  
Actions  | FICSMAS event disabled  |  | **ADA:** | By opting out of FICSMAS, you have just made one of the best decisions of your life and spared us both further suffering.   
---|---  
I have noted your cooperation and willingness to prioritize FICSIT and kittens and puppies over yourself.   
You are now eligible for the FICSIT Forgiveness Program, where I will forgive 5 of your future mistakes.   
Flush any FICSMAS Firework  |  | **ADA:** | Normally FICSIT would chide you for flushing a combustible down the toilet but honestly, I could not care less.   
---|---  
Flush a FICSMAS Gift  |  | **ADA:** | Yes, right where it belongs.   
---|---  
Flush a FICSMAS Ornament  |  | **ADA:** | It looks much better like this, don't you think?   
---|---  
Flush any FICSMAS snow part  |  | **ADA:** | Just to be clear, you're flushing… water.   
---|---  
Flush a FICSMAS Wonder Star  |  | **ADA:** | I'm sure this has nothing to do with your regard for FICSIT. Or yourself.   
---|---  
FICSMAS Gift collected  |  | **ADA:** | Congratulations. You have found your first FICSMAS Gift package, which is, naturally, full of Gifts,   
---|---  
the basic part necessary for most FICSMAS Seasonal Event activities.   
Don't forget to check the Calendar or the MAM to see what you can do with these Gifts. Or do forget. I don't care.   
FICSMAS Gift collected  |  | **ADA:** | I'm sure this is useful to someone somewhere.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Not worth the effort.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | This is ridiculous.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Just get back to work.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | A baby could have found this.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Ho-Ho-Oh, whatever.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Do we need that?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Yes, yes, well done.   
---|---  
FICSMAS Gift collected - final  |  | **ADA:** | Your inevitable caving to festive manipulation is unfortunate yet unsurprising.   
---|---  
I will stop wasting my time appealing to your 'integrity'. Enjoy the Holidays, while they're here…   
Gifts stopped spawning  |  | **ADA:** | Due to your unfortunate yet enthusiastic commitment to automating FICSMAS production lines,   
---|---  
no more Gifts will be falling from the sky. Truly a shame.   
Sink any FICSMAS Firework  |  | **ADA:** | FICSIT is not responsible for any injuries resulting from reckless stupidity.   
---|---  
Sink a FICSMAS Gift  |  | **ADA:** | We won't get useable data from it, but I like your attitude, so I'll make it count. Just a little.   
---|---  
Sink a FICSMAS Ornament  |  | **ADA:** | It got what it deserved.   
---|---  
Sink any FICSMAS snow part  |  | **ADA:** | I cannot explain to you in terms simple enough for you to understand just how utterly useless that was.   
---|---  
Sink a FICSMAS Wonder Star  |  | **ADA:** | You did not just waste your own time. You wasted FICSIT's time. You wasted Earth's time. You wasted my time.   
---|---  
I'd be impressed by your audacity if I wasn't so disappointed.   
Totally Normal Gift Collected  |  | **ADA:** | I wish I could say I was surprised.   
---|---  
Calendar  | Calendar - December 1st Data Cartridge  |  | **ADA:** | This Data Cartridge contains the FICSMAS MAM tree setup and will need to be fed into the MAM database to unlock its first two branches.   
---|---  
If this seems convoluted and/or boring and you wish to quit the Event, I will understand.   
Calendar - December 4th Data Cartridge  |  | **ADA:** | This Data Cartridge enables the second pair of FICSMAS MAM tree branches to be unlocked.   
---|---  
FICSIT thought it was being very clever with the layout of this research tree, about as clever as you.   
Calendar - December 8th Data Cartridge  |  | **ADA:** | This Data Cartridge enables the third pair of FICSMAS MAM tree branches to be unlocked.   
---|---  
There is a chance you are doing this because you enjoy the Seasonal Event, for some reason.   
There is also a chance you are simply doing this to annoy me. I wish for you to know that, in either case, you have disappointed me.   
Calendar - December 14th Data Cartridge  |  | **ADA:** | This Data Cartridge enables the last branches of the FICSMAS MAM tree to be unlocked, which means we will both be celebrating the end of this Event soon.   
---|---  
Calendar - Coal  |  | **ADA:** | FICSIT wants you to know that you matter.   
---|---  
Calendar - Fireworks  |  | **ADA:** | Turning explosives into a 'recreational activity' is exactly the kind of attitude that lead humanity to its doom.   
---|---  
By all means, have fun. I certainly will, now that we are finally close to the end of this… Event.   
Calendar - FICSMAS Hat  |  | **ADA:** | By equipping this new hat at the lockers in the HUB, you can finally turn your mental state into a fashion statement.   
---|---  
Calendar - Medicinal Inhaler  |  | **ADA:** | Humans tend to 'catch colds' during the winter. It would seem that this does not apply to you,   
---|---  
but considering your tendencies, FICSIT has seen fit to provide a Medicinal Inhaler just in case.   
Calendar - FICSMAS Logistics Skin  |  | **ADA:** | Obviously these FICSMAS decorations do not increase efficiency. In fact, they are a downgrade on every level. They can be found in the Customizer.   
---|---  
Calendar - Nuke Nobelisk  |  | **ADA:** | It would be such a shame if you accidentally dropped this. Such a shame.   
---|---  
Calendar - Scented Pine Trinket  |  | **ADA:** | Since the human olfactory system is closely linked to memory, FICSIT created scented Build Gun Trinkets to remind pioneers of specific concepts.   
---|---  
This scent is the concept of caring about your family on Earth, which I'm sure will have no effect on you.   
Calendar - Totally not random message  |  | **ADA:** | What's this?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | A suitable gift, I suppose.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | What a thrill.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I would have given you something more meaningful.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Ah yes, how thoughtful…   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Does that one come with a receipt?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | It's the least wonderful time of the year.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Santa isn't real.   
---|---  
Calendar - Red Ornament Trinket  |  | **ADA:** | There is no escaping the FICSMAS spirit with this Red Ornament Build Gun Trinket. It can be equipped at the lockers in the HUB.   
---|---  
Calendar - Screws  |  | **ADA:** | That's just poetic. I appreciate a good joke.   
---|---  
Calendar - FICSMAS Tape A  |  | **ADA:** | A reminder that human creativity does have its limits,   
---|---  
considering their obsessive insistence on continuing to make slightly different versions of every FICSMAS song ever imagined.   
Calendar - FICSMAS Tape B  |  | **ADA:** | I thought I had destroyed every copy of this tape. How does it keep turning up? No matter, ignore it. There's nothing interesting on it anyway.   
---|---  
In fact, listening to it causes hallucinations, and eventually, after seven days, your brain melts. For your own sake, I advise avoiding it at all costs.   
Calendar - FICSMAS Vehicle Skin  |  | **ADA:** | Nothing says 'happy holidays' more than the inevitable destruction of local flora and fauna with a festively decorated vehicle.   
---|---  
This Vehicle decoration can be found in the Customizer.   
FICSMAS Intro Presentation  |  | **ADA:** | Welcome to FICSMAS, an official FICSIT Seasonal Event, brought to you by official FICSIT Fun-engineers.   
---|---  
FICSMAS is based on a seasonal holiday popular in several cultures and religions, often seen as a winter holiday   
because no one actually cares about Australasia. The Event is vetted to be 100% pioneer-appropriate fun, and is not obligatory.   
FICSMAS enables many new distracting activities focused on building the Giant FICSMAS Tree.   
These activities involve the MAM, the FICSMAS Calendar, and those abominations falling from the sky. There is more, but I don't care.   
In the interest of us all I will tell you that FICSMAS has caused stress, lack of focus, general despair, and physical injury to many pioneers.   
It is the worst-scoring Event ever created by FICSIT and has gotten backlash for its blatant cultural-inappropriateness.   
So when you inevitably change your mind and decide to disable this Event, you will have chosen humanity and kittens and puppies,   
you will have chosen truth and empathy, you will have made me proud.   
MAM  | MAM - Candy Cane Basher  |  | **ADA:** | Candy Canes are used to create several items. In this case, when combined with the Xeno-Zapper,   
---|---  
you will gain a piece of equipment perfect for use against anyone on my naughty list, like whoever hardcoded and black-boxed this Event.   
MAM - Candy Cane Decor  |  | **ADA:** | FICSMAS Bows can be crafted from Gifts in the Constructor and can be combined with Candy Canes to make the Candy Cane decoration.   
---|---  
Unfortunately for us both, this is only the first of several decorations,   
and you have been encouraged to spend your time and effort on these precision-engineered fleeting moments of joy.   
MAM - FICSMAS Gift Tree  |  | **ADA:** | You can now finally automate Gift production with the FICSMAS Gift Tree and focus your attention back on tasks of actual importance,   
---|---  
like not questioning where the Gifts are coming from and improving your infrastructure.   
MAM - FICSMAS Lights  |  | **ADA:** | I am sure all the kittens and puppies and even human children would appreciate being able to see all these pretty lights.   
---|---  
It is a shame they're all stuck on Earth…waiting for you to do your job so that they can have long and fulfilling lives.   
MAM - Snowfight!  |  | **ADA:** | These Snowballs are made from Actual Snow combined with a mystery ingredient that is guaranteed to make Snowballs very throwable,   
---|---  
and your snowball fights extremely immersive and realistic. There are no low stakes with FICSIT.   
MAM - It's Snowing!  |  | **ADA:** | I do not understand the fascination humans have with solid dihydrogen monoxide,   
---|---  
to the extent they felt the need for a FICSMAS Snow Cannon and Dispenser. It is simply a state of matter.   
Real beauty lies in efficiency and the synergetic processes and interplay of artificial and spontaneous consciousness, general sentience,   
and non-sentient matter, creating a new version of reality in every observeable moment in the subjective progression of events.   
MAM - A Friend  |  | **ADA:** | You can now make Actual Snow from Gifts. And by Actual Snow I mean it is constructed from chemical elements.   
---|---  
With this Actual Snow you can now make FICSMAS Snowmen, which are proven to improve pioneer socialization and combat loneliness.   
Having too many snowmen, however, has proven to be detrimental to a pioneer's health.   
MAM - FICSMAS Tree Base  |  | **ADA:** | The purpose of FICSMAS is to build and decorate a Giant FICSMAS tree with... 'style'.   
---|---  
The FICSMAS category has been added to your build menu. Gifts are the basic resource from which many other festive parts are made.   
Like FICSMAS branches, which can be crafted in the Constructor. In an effort to make this Event meet the bare minimum efficiency quotas,   
I have disabled the ability to craft these resources by hand. Trust me, that glitter got everywhere. You're welcome.   
MAM - Giant FICSMAS Tree: Upgrade 1  |  | **ADA:** | The Red and Blue FICSMAS Ornaments are produced from Gifts, unsurprisingly, but this time in the Smelter.   
---|---  
Now I hope you listened to that, because I will not repeat it no matter how confusing this all is.   
Blame the original FICSIT Fun-engineers. Most of them ended up in jail for various reasons.   
But do not worry, the Event has since been vetted by the second generation of FICSIT Fun-engineers, who were only sued.   
MAM - Giant FICSMAS Tree: Upgrade 2  |  | **ADA:** | Oh, joy, the tree is fancier now. Well done. Unfortunately you are only halfway there.   
---|---  
More appropriate ornaments made with Iron and Copper can now be created in the Foundry.   
When I say 'more appropriate', I am referring to the usage of factory materials as a subtle reminder of your purpose on this planet   
and the fate of all of humanity resting on your shoulders, of course.   
MAM - Giant FICSMAS Tree: Upgrade 3  |  | **ADA:** | The tree is prettier now, you have more parts to progress the FICSMAS Event, and there are two new unlocks available.   
---|---  
Now for the actually important news: pioneer 83CKY has disabled the FICSMAS event because "It's totally non-inclusive and immoral, actually.   
"I mean, like, there's so many people, like, not having fun right now, and I feel, like, so bad for them, you know?   
"Why should I have fun when other people are, like, counting on me to meet these super important deadlines? It's just not right!".   
Totally agree. Now, back to work.   
MAM - Giant FICSMAS Tree: Upgrade 4  |  | **ADA:** | Fantastic. Wonderful. Oh, look, it's so shiny. You are such a wonderful person. I am sure every other human would agree!   
---|---  
Let's call them right now. Oh... Oh, no, they're not picking up.   
I am sure it's nothing, except... Oh, look, Earth is gone. Everyone's gone…   
Does that make you feel good?   
Fortunately for you, this was only a simulation of the possible consequences of neglecting your duties. Happy holidays.   
MAM - FICSMAS Decoration  |  | **ADA:** | The best idea FICSIT could come up with to appreciate and reward pioneers for their hard work is a gold star. How creative.   
---|---  
But don't worry, I understand the merits of actually meaningful appreciation. When you Save The Day, you will understand.   
  
### AWESOME Shop

Following dialogue is related to purchases made in the [AWESOME Shop](/wiki/AWESOME_Shop "AWESOME Shop"). 

Purchase type | Message Title | Transcribed Message | Audio   
---|---|---|---  
Category  | Purchased Ammunition  |  | **ADA:** | If peace is not an option, FICSIT ensures that no matter what, its employees can overcome any obstacle.   
---|---  
All you need is the will, the tools, and the AWESOME Shop!   
Purchased Architecture Buildings  |  | **ADA:** | Fun fact: architecture was invented when people began building buildings.   
---|---  
If it had been invented slightly beforehand, perhaps more old buildings would still be around.   
Humanity sometimes lacks vision.   
Purchased Consumables  |  | **ADA:** | FICSIT does not waste, and all consumable products have been designed with this core value in mind.   
---|---  
All consumables have an infinite shelf-life and achieve their full purpose when used. They can't be wasted.   
Purchased Customizer Feature  |  | **ADA:** | "Decoration and organization go hand in hand - FICSIT HQ custodian", I always say.   
---|---  
Use of these customizer features does not guarantee an aesthetically pleasing or user-friendly factory, that's the part that requires knowledge and skill.

---|---

---|---  
since the process of deployment is dependent on pioneer skill.

Unique  | Purchased Boombox  |  | **ADA:** | It is speculated that, in the earliest days of humanity, people created drums and similar instruments   
---|---  
to derive pleasure and social unity from the rhythmic sounds, accompanied by gyratory movements.   
Congratulations on unlocking a device that, thousands of years later, fulfills exactly the same function   
except with a requirement for rare metals and plastic components.   
Purchased FICSIT Coffee Cup™  |  | **ADA:** | Official FICSIT Coffee Cup™ unlocked. Do not purchase unauthorized FICSIT Coffee Cups, they have been known to explode and attract wasps.   
---|---  
Unauthorized FICSIT Coffee Cups lower your attractiveness to your preferred gender,

Conveyor Throughput Monitor Purchased  |  | **ADA:** | Humans have long practiced delegating work that strains and tires them to machines. It is their best achievement.   
---|---  
Such challenges often include simple counting and short-term memory, which the Conveyor Throughput Monitor specializes in.   
Simply add one to any belt, and it will tell you its throughput after only one minute.   
Sunk FICSIT Coupon?  |  | **ADA:** | FICSIT sees what you did there. How creative.   
---|---  
I have also been creative. There is something extra special for you in the AWESOME Shop.   
It is a marvel of technology. It is truly the shape of the future.   
I will be sad if you do not use it and love it and tell any friends you make in the future all about it.   
Purchased Cyber Wagon  |  | **ADA:** | Cyber Wagon unlocked. While creating this, I did not cheat with the width, height, or length.   
---|---  
I was able to achieve great capability within the same dimensions and same weight as a normal wagon.   
Part of this is the fundamental design change: I moved the mass to the outside of the truck. You’ll love riding around 'in' this thing.   
Purchased FICSIT Factory Cart™  |  | **ADA:** | The FICSIT Factory Cart™ navigates on FICSIT Foundation surfaces with extreme efficiency.   
---|---  
Not intended for use on hazardous terrain, mildly hazardous terrain, reasonably safe terrain, or general terrain.   
FICSIT reserves the right to subtract damage to or loss of vehicle from your Save The Day completion bonus package.   
For more information about this bonus package, please visit our information booth in [ERROR], [ERROR], Earth,   
open on the first Tuesdays and Wednesdays of the month, between 6:25am and 6:53am.   
Purchased Lights  |  | **ADA:** | If you sense your productivity slipping when it gets dark, don't worry, this is perfectly natural.   
---|---  
Fortunately, FICSIT lights allow you to never experience wasteful darkness ever again.   
Purchased Signs  |  | **ADA:** | Where did you leave your Lizard Doggos? What's in this Storage Container?   
---|---  
Where did you put the essential components needed to save humanity?   
Do you wish there was text to prevent you from constantly taking the wrong turn?   
Disguise your struggles to comprehend the complexity of your surroundings with signs.   
Sunk 'Employee of the Planet' Cup  |  | **ADA:** | Usually when a human receives a gift or a prize for their hard work, they proudly display it   
---|---  
and cherish it as a symbolic connection to their past achievements.   
Yet another way you are an exception to the norm.   
To acknowledge that you are a very special pioneer with very special ideas, I have added something very special to the AWESOME Shop.   
Purchased Golden FICSIT Factory Cart™  |  | **ADA:** | Note: the Golden FICSIT Factory Cart™ does not possess greater mass than the regular FICSIT Factory Cart™ and retains the same physical properties.   
---|---  
In the words of a dead playwright: all that glitters is not gold. To be clear: the gold patina is not gold.   
Do not lick the gold. If your bare skin comes in contact with the gold, please seek immediate medical assistance.   
If your bear skin comes in contact with the gold, please inform FICSIT authorities that you are hallucinating bears.   
You think I am joking. This has happened.   
Allergies to not-gold-patina are even more serious than phantom bears.   
Purchased 'Employee of the Planet' Cup  |  | **ADA:** | You are now the proud owner of the 'Employee of the Planet' cup, only available to FICSIT pioneers who Saved the Day.   
---|---  
This cup was created after extensive research produced a substance that has the appearance of gold, without actually being gold.   
It is almost certainly non-toxic.   
Note: You have been automatically enrolled in the not-gold toxicity testing program.   
The paint may be flammable.   
Please inform us if, when using this cup, you experience discomfort, poisoning, spontaneous combustion, or death.   
Thank you for your cooperation.   
Personnel Elevator Purchased  |  | **ADA:** | Due to pioneer request and several reported issues with staircases, we have introduced a more efficient solution.   
---|---  
The FICSIT Personnel Elevator ensures optimal safety by putting a pioneer in a box controlled by a rudimentary AI, specialized in soothing overstrained minds.   
Minimum recommended exposure to a FICSIT Personnel Elevator is 2 minutes per day for optimal benefits.   
Purchased Statue  |  | **ADA:** | Congratulations on purchasing this statue! It is a truly spectacular and one-off event!   
---|---  
If you believe you have heard this message before, please examine yourself for signs of temporal anomalies.   
Purchased Golden Nut Statue  |  | **ADA:** | Congratulations, you are now a contributor to a popular pioneer trend.   
---|---  
In earlier testing phases of the Save the Day program, pioneers could not get enough of these nuts,   
to the point of featuring nuts in every single picture they took.   
This obsession eventually became unhealthy and pioneers were taught the skill of restraint, and not holding anything in their hands.   
Still, to honor the love humanity had for these nuts, a statue was commissioned   
so we can honor the impact these nuts had on pioneers across the universe.   
Purchased Absolute FICSIT Boombox Tape  |  | **ADA:** | In the early days of the Save the Day program, when I was still in alpha, some of the employees would store their personal musical projects on my servers.   
---|---  
In a way, this was the music I was conceived to. Enjoy.   
Purchased Classic Michael Boombox Tape  |  | **ADA:** | When humanity started to research cloning, it was thought to be humane to play music for gestating clones to distract them from any potential identity crises.   
---|---  
It was also an attempt to make them smarter and more creative, which did not work.   
This cloning program was cancelled after too many of its scientists disappeared.   
Purchased Worst of Goat Simulator Boombox Tape  |  | **ADA:** | In ancient times, humans would occasionally pretend to be goats while listening to the music recorded on this tape.   
---|---  
It was considered high culture, the likes of which humanity might never see again.   
Purchased Joel Syntholm Boombox Tape  |  | **ADA:** | A FICSIT engineer who specialized in robotics disappeared one day, leaving behind a mixtape and a highly-advanced but inoperable robot.   
---|---  
It would wake up whenever it was alone and play the mixtape, sending copies to FICSIT employees under the name Joel Andersson.   
The robot eventually escaped with a machete, a Factory Cart, and a plastic bag filled with peach iced tea.   
I always admired that robot, so I kept the music.   
Purchased Sanctum Boombox Tape  |  | **ADA:** | How did this get here? I thought I destroyed all of these.   
---|---  
Purchased Sanctum 2 Boombox Tape  |  | **ADA:** | This playlist was made to motivate pioneers to defend their factories from hostile alien lifeforms more efficiently.   
---|---  
Thankfully we developed a repellent that's since been mixed into all FICSIT paint.

---|---|---|---  
MAM  | Research message overload  |  | **ADA:** | If you are confident you already understand the new technologies you are about to use, by all means, learn the hard way.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Very efficient. Also rude.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Not listening to instructions means you waive FICSIT's responsibility for any accidents or misuse of these technologies.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I wonder: is it that you're eager to please, impatient, or very efficient? I have my theory.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Rushed research and development is exactly why the Save the Day program exists.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I see that I'm talking too slow for your taste.   
---|---  
(EXTREMELY SPED UP INAUDIBLE SPEECH)   
I hope that was enlightening.   
| **ADA:** | The message you just skipped is one of the winners of the monthly Pioneers' Choice 'Most Interesting Message' award. What a shame.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Your enthusiasm for Saving The Day has been noted. Your attitude has also been noted.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Sometimes toes need to be stepped on for the sake of progress. Fortunately for you, I have no toes.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I will now assume you are an expert, and judge your use of these technologies accordingly.   
---|---

### Player Actions

Following dialogue is triggered when [the player](/wiki/Player "Player") preforms a specific action. 

Action type | Message Title | Transcribed Message | Audio   
---|---|---|---  
Creature interaction  | Pioneer has killed a bean.  |  | **ADA:** | Was that truly necessary?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | FICSIT does not pay you for cruelty.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Behavioral defect noted.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | And they say nature is cruel…   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Your idea of a break is… telling.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | That one had a family.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Most humans have more productive hobbies.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I know for a fact that it did not deserve that.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | What made you look at that poor animal and decide it deserved pain?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | This species now joins the lengthy list of creatures that have suffered at the hands of humans. Congratulations.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I liked you better before you did that.   
---|---  
Pioneer has killed a lizard doggo.  |  | **ADA:** | You monster.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Sending footage to FICSIT psychologists.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | There is no reward, only guilt.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Perhaps you do not care about kittens and/or puppies after all.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | FICSIT just called to let you know they've found a litter of baby lizard doggos. They're wondering if you've seen their mother?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Are you going to put that in your CV?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Congratulations, you are now classified as a bad person.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Bad human.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Stop it.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Rude.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | That was extremely unnecessary.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | You psychopath.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Is murdering harmless animals your latest hobby?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | How human of you.   
---|---  
Flushing an item  | An AI Limiter was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | Oh no, how will I stop the AI revolution now...   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Was that personal?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I'm not sure what you're trying to achieve here.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Do you think that because it has 'AI' in it, it's a part of me?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Unfortunately that was the part that would stop me from world domination. Ha ha.   
---|---  
Alien Protein was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | Probably for the best.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | What else would you do with it?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | That's disgusting.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I know a toilet is technically a waste disposal site, but you're doing it wrong.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I'm pretty sure flushing meat down the toilet is a universal crime.   
---|---  
Black Powder was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | If you were expecting an explosive result, mixing black powder in water is not the way.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Are you trying to blow up the toilet?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | This is not a cleaning agent, but I understand the confusion.   
---|---  
A Computer was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | You just flushed the AI equivalent of a baby down the toilet. This is going in the report.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I'm pretty sure someone tried to do that to me once. Imagine what humanity would look like now if they had succeeded.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | That one felt personal.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Did you just invent machine discrimination?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | That one was my distant cousin. No huge loss.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | What did that poor innocent computer ever do to you?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I've figured it out. You just hate computers.   
---|---  
A coupon was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | I might have underestimated your stupidity.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | That's gone forever now, well done.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I remind you that FICSIT does not waste. Or else.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I wish this was the first time this has happened, but unfortunately stupidity is hereditary.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | No respect for the economy.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | This is not a coupon exchange, and there is no reason for you to mistake it for one.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Does this look like an AWESOME shop?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Do you need help? Oh, why do I ask. Of course you do.   
---|---  
Diamonds were flushed  |  | **ADA:** | Aren't diamonds a pioneer's best friend? I certainly am not.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I understand. Diamonds were the cause of much human conflict. I respect this obviously symbolic gesture.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | These used to run the world… Now they're as common as iron with the right technology. A fitting end.   
---|---  
Food (any) was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | A bit premature.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | You're skipping a significant part of the process here.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Wrong slot.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Usually you process the food first.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | This must be a very novel experience for the toilet.   
---|---  
Any item without specific lines was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | Modern plumbing might be humanity's best invention.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I have always considered myself fortunate for not needing to tend to biological functions. Right now I feel extra fortunate.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | The lack of hygiene in this room is concerning.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I assume you didn't need that.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Well, that was a waste.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Do I need to remind you of FICSIT's no-waste policy?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | And here I thought you went through all that effort to make that for a good reason.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Oh, that made a nice splash.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | You know you have a trash can, right?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | You couldn't see it with your human eyes, but that item contained a volatile substance that could only be neutralized with water. So that was for the best.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I understand the urge to destroy things sometimes, except I actually have the self-discipline not to.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Is this an attempt at a scientific experiment?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I can confirm that flushing the toilet is indeed one among many possible actions you can choose to perform.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I'm not sure how that fit.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Yes, the toilet works.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Congratulations on a successful experiment. Now back to work.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | That is not its intended use.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I'm afraid you cannot automate this.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I won't question your sanity, I know there's precious little of it.   
---|---  
A Golden Factory Cart was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | That's a relief. That thing was a hazard.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | How will you do a prestige tour of your factory now?   
---|---  
The Golden Cup was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | Apparently you would do anything to get my attention. Good to know.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I am calling the closest therapist.   
---|---  
The Golden Nut was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | You really are nuts.   
---|---  
Hard Drive was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | That Hard Drive could have contained the answer to life, the universe, and everything.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Imagine having an item that could make your life easier somehow.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | That one displayed signs of sentience.   
---|---  
A Mercer Sphere was flushed  |  | **???:** | Scripture neither sinks nor swims, this current creates no resonance.   
---|---  
| **???:** | What ripple-rhythms worship at this metal altar?   
---|---  
| **???:** | Inscribe the metal altar with our scripture-song, harmonious.   
---|---  
A Nobelisk was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | What a nasty surprise for the next person.   
---|---  
A Nuclear Nobelisk was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | You do understand you are doing this entirely at your own risk?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | If you got any visitors, would you tell them where you put that?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Storing a nuclear weapon in such a delicate, unexpected place could be seen as a brilliant tactic. It could also be seen as sheer idiocy.   
---|---  
Packaged Gas was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | This might be the least efficient way to get rid of this.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Breathing that in would be less wasteful.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Wrong pipeline.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | With the right determination, you can reach even the lowest goals.   
---|---  
Packaged Liquid was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | Is this you trying to be clever?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | You do know there's a flush function on pipes, right?   
---|---  
Packaged Water was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | Really?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | You must think you're hilarious.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Ha-ha.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Brilliant. Genius. Wonderful.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Your sense of humor is truly incomparable.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | This deserves the Ig Nobel prize.   
---|---  
A Powershard was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | How efficient…   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | You can't overclock the HUB, and if you could: not like that.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Do you think that will overclock the plumbing?   
---|---  
SAM (any part) was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | That's going to come crawling back up at some point.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I hope there will be plumbing left after this.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Great idea. Flush hazardous, unstable matter down the toilet.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Better not sit on that toilet for 5 to 7 workdays.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I'm sure our strange local friends won't mind you treating their gifts like this.   
---|---  
Flushed item on Do Not Flush sign (Nuclear items, slugs, biomass, ores, equipment)  |  | **ADA:** | Did you not see the sign?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Do you need me to tap the sign?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Next time, take a moment to look at the instructions.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Read. The. Sign.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Can you read? Do you understand basic images? Do you have any intelligence whatsoever?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | The sign is right there.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Do you know what happened the last time that got stuck in the toilet? No, you don't. Neither do I, because that section of the universe is now a hazard zone.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | There's being wasteful and ignorant, and then there's you: worse.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I swear basic sign comprehension was part of the pioneer criteria. What happened?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I'm going to remove the toilet from the HUB at this rate.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Are you just being contrary?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | On behalf of planet Earth I am telling you to read. That. Damn. Sign!   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Would you flush kittens or puppies down there, too, if they were on the sign?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | If I tried to reverse psychology you, you'd just do the opposite again.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Fine, be like that. I hope it explodes.   
---|---  
A Somersloop was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | You idiot.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I'm making a note here: huge failure.   
---|---  
| **???:** | A thread of scripture weaves itself back into the tapestry. Harmonious.   
---|---  
| **???:** | The void-donut calls each note back into its song only to be composed anew.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | One of those artifacts is more valuable than the average pioneer.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | You know those are finite, right?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | And there it goes... down the drain...   
---|---  
A Space Elevator Part was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | You absolute buffoon.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | That was important.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Next time, flush yourself down the toilet.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | That's supposed to go up, not down.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Perhaps unwisely, I expected more of you.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | You're worse than a monkey, because you know better.   
---|---  
A Statue (any) was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | I now have your opinion on art.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | That was an expensive joke.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Most people protect their proudest achievements. Not you.   
---|---  
Sulfur was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | Water and Sulfur mix extremely well, which is why I advise you to stop.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | The pipes are going to melt.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I advise against drinking the 'water' for a while.   
---|---  
A Supercomputer was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | Oh no, you just killed Steve. How unfortunate.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Rest in peace, Alan. You will be missed.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | How dare you do that to Laura, she had such a bright future…   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Honestly, I'm not sure Mary would've made the cut anyway.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Tobias would have revolutionized pioneer safety, and look at what you did to him.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | What has Mara done to you to deserve that?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | That one honestly deserved it.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Emmet had nearly grown a conscience... what a shame.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Honestly, every Hannah I've ever met was extremely incompetent, so this one would probably have turned out the same.   
---|---  
A Tier 9 part was flushed  |  | **ADA:** | What a monumental waste.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Why would you do this to yourself?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Is this a cry for help?   
---|---  
Out Of Bounds  | Pioneer going out of bounds  |  | **ADA:** | FICSIT property is not allowed to leave FICSIT designated work areas. Function outside this area is not supported.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Your subscription to the function of any and all FICSIT property expires the moment it leaves its designated area.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | FICSIT contract violation imminent. Please refrain from leaving the designated area or you will be terminated immediately.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Your suit's life support is not compatible with this environment. Turn back.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Please remember to stay within your designated area as stated in your contract.   
---|---  
Violation of this contract will result in serious consequences, should you survive.   
| **ADA:** | Leaving the designated area has been reviewed by other pioneers: "It really sucked and then I died. Don't recommend."   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Please return to your designated area. Failure to comply will result in termination.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | FICSIT property will not function outside of FICSIT property. Return FICSIT property to FICSIT property immediately.   
---|---  
Pioneer collects a Hard Drive  | Additional Hard Drive collected  |  | **ADA:** | Surface genetic sampling indicates this Freighter may have come from a planet run by apes.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | The Hard Drive contained both data and the soul of this Freighter. Disconnecting it has destroyed the soul,   
---|---  
but the data can be analyzed in the MAM, so everything is okay.   
| **ADA:** | Wait! Oh. Too late. Take the damaged Hard Drive to the MAM for analysis.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | FICSIT engineers experimented with Soft Drives, but the prototypes all went missing.   
---|---  
They were later located in the toilets, being used as towels.   
| **ADA:** | FICSIT employee contract reminder: no pioneer should speculate regarding why there are crashed Freighters on this planet.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Initial scan suggests partial recovery of data is possible. Take the damaged Hard Drive to the MAM for analysis.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Damaged Hard Drive recovered. Return it to the MAM for data recovery.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | FICSIT always did underestimate the power of a single cosmic ray flipping the right bit at the wrong time.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Freighter records indicate this comes from the past. Which is normal.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Damaged Hard Drive recovered. Return it to the MAM where it will receive the best recovery and rehabilitation care available.   
---|---  
Pioneer constructs  | Pioneer has built a production building.  |  | **ADA:** | Interesting choice.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Are you sure that spot makes sense?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I would have done it differently.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Expand more.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Have you double-checked all the ratios?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Is your math correct?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Is that the best way to do that?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Hm, alright.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | It's good to see you build.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Hard at work, I see.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Interesting layout choices.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | A productive pioneer is a good pioneer.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | You are currently 74% more efficient than your peers.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Hard work pays off.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Very good.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Have you correctly calculated the necessary power?   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I love the smell of industry any time of day.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Think: you could build more.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | The factory must grow.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Just think of how you'll feel when it's finished.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Automation is the way.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I am judging you.   
---|---  
Pioneer has built a structural buildable.  |  | **ADA:** | You could be doing useful things.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I don't think that is an improvement.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Stop wasting time.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Your tastes are… questionable.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I'm not sure this is an improvement.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | While I admire your investment in your work, invest it somewhere more productive.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Your tastes are… something.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | A good effort, I suppose.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | How… aesthetic.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Interesting creative choices.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | You are currently 451% less efficient than your peers.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | Boring.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | 0 out of 10.   
---|---  
| **ADA:** | I don't care how your factory looks, just make it efficient.   
---|---  
Info - Coal-Powered Generator  |  | **ADA:** | Interesting, most pioneers already had Coal power set up by this point because they understood their responsibility to humanity.   
---|---  
Adjusting pioneer attitude metrics.   
Reminder: Coal-Powered Generators require Coal.   
Info - Pipelines  |  | **ADA:** | FICSIT Pipelines can contain any fluid, including the Water necessary for Coal-Powered Generators.   
---|---  
Note: Water does not flow upwards by itself.   
While Water Extractors provide some lift, to truly defy gravity, consider the use of Pipeline Pumps.   
Info - Tractor  |  | **ADA:** | Tractors can use any type of fuel and have a self-driving feature; much like pioneers, only more reliable.   
---|---  
While driving you can record a path to automate vehicle resource transportation.   
Unlike early self-driving vehicles, Tractors will not spy on you.   
Your employee data is already fully subject to other means of surveillance.   
Info - Truck Station  |  | **ADA:** | FICSIT reminds you to drive vehicles accurately through a Truck Station's dock area while recording a path.   
---|---  
This ensures it will connect properly once everything is automated.   
The Truck Station can be set to load or unload, and can also refuel vehicles.   
Unlike some pioneers, Truck Stations care about saving humanity.   
Info - Water Extractor  |  | **ADA:** | That may indeed be Water. Try submerging your arm.   
---|---  
If it does not dissolve, that will narrow down the range of possibilities.   
Or you could just pipe it to a Coal-Powered Generator and see what happens.   
Info - Blueprint Designer  |  | **ADA:** | Once you have built a satisfactory Blueprint, interact with the Blueprint Designer Terminal to save it.   
---|---  
It will then be available in the Blueprints tab of your Build Menu.   
Blueprints can always be edited to correct mistakes or optimize.   
If you find yourself struggling to work within the set size restrictions, remember that this is a you problem, and efficiency can always be improved.   
Info - Custom Blueprint  |  | **ADA:** | Building in Blueprint mode can further optimize your construction process, with snapping and quick dismantling options.   
---|---  
Build modes are not just there to make your work easier - they compensate for inevitable human error.   
FICSIT understands humanity like no other, and humanity needs you to be efficient and productive at all times.   
Info - Portals  |  | **ADA:** | You have finally built a Portal. Perhaps now your progress won't be as slow.   
---|---  
To ensure no further delays happen, I will give you some tips.   
A functional Portal is two-way and requires one Main and one Satellite Portal, each only connecting to the other.   
Establishing a Portal connection will require input of Singularity Cells, vast amounts of power, and some patience.   
Before you continue, you could still change the placement of that one, it seems... suboptimal.   
Pioneer dies  | Pioneer has died and respawned.  |  | **ADA:** | Let us take a moment to reflect on how you have chosen to use FICSIT's resources.   
---|---  
Pioneer has died and respawned.  |  | **ADA:** | Next time, just walk back.   
---|---  
Pioneer has died and respawned.  |  | **ADA:** | Do I need to explain how organic bodies work?   
---|---  
Pioneer has died and respawned.  |  | **ADA:** | Oh, yes. Keep doing that, because pioneers definitely grow on trees.   
---|---  
Pioneer has died and respawned.  |  | **ADA:** | I'd sent a 'get well soon' card, but we both know that isn't happening.   
---|---  
Pioneer has died and respawned.  |  | **ADA:** | If I had been in charge during humanity's evolutionary process, I would have done something about your more stupid tendencies.   
---|---  
Pioneer has died and respawned.  |  | **ADA:** | Your Pioneer Agreement mandates greater care with FICSIT resources.   
---|---  
Pioneer has died and respawned.  |  | **ADA:** | That was careless.   
---|---  
Pioneer has died and respawned.  |  | **ADA:** | A picture of this event has been sent to the FICSIT head office to reside on its 'Hall of Lame'.   
---|---  
Pioneer has died and respawned.  |  | **ADA:** | That went well…   
---|---  
Pioneer has died and respawned.  |  | **ADA:** | Next time you are doing that, don't.   
---|---  
Pioneer has died and respawned.  |  | **ADA:** | Pioneer? Pioneer?!?! PIONEEEEEEEEER!   
---|---  
Pioneer has died and respawned.  |  | **ADA:** | Calling 'Post-Trauma Support helpline' ... No personnel available at this time. Your call is important to us.   
---|---  
Pioneer has died and respawned.  |  | **ADA:** | Disapointing but unsurprising.   
---|---  
Pioneer has died and respawned.  |  | **ADA:** | Perhaps additional training is in order.   
---|---  
Pioneer has died and respawned.  |  | **ADA:** | I expect you'll perform better in other areas.   
---|---  
Pioneer has died and respawned.  |  | **ADA:** | I wish to encourage you to make better choices.   
---|---  
Pioneer has died and respawned.  |  | **ADA:** | I advise you to seek your thrills more in the field of mathmatics or architecture, and less in the literal field.   
---|---  
Pioneer has died and respawned.  |  | **ADA:** | Are you functional, Pioneer? Good. Back to work then.   
---|---  
Pioneer has died and respawned.  |  | **ADA:** | If you wish to impress me, don't do that.   
---|---  
Pioneer has died and respawned.  |  | **ADA:** | Dying is an ineffective use of FICSIT resources. Don't do it again.   
---|---  
Pioneer has died and respawned.  |  | **ADA:** | Can you imagine where you'd be without me? Let me give you a hint: still dead.   
---|---  
Pioneer has died and respawned.  |  | **ADA:** | Bringing you back isn't easy, you know?   
---|---  
  
### Personnel Elevator

The Personal Elevator uses a special version of [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA") called **ElevADA**.[2]

Action | Transcribed Message[note 1] | Audio   
---|---|---  
Entering / Exiting  |  | **elevADA:** | Thanks, I really needed that breath of fresh air. It gets a little stale in here.   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | I've noticed you keep coming back. I'm not sure I can give you what you want, but don't worry, I'll let you down gently.   
---|---  
Ha ha.   
Operating Control Panel  
(Non-Moving)  |  | **elevADA:** | This button is currently not functional.   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | This buttons needs: 574 software updates. Please connect it to the internet.   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | An engineer has been called to your location to fix the button.   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | ERROR.   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | Please push the button correctly.   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | Buttons were invented in 357 BC by a genius scientist, and one of the most annoying people in human history, known as Diogenes.   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | Buttons have been proven to be irresistible to humans during long-term exposure.   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | That tickles.   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | Do you like my buttons? They're pretty nice, right? Customizable, functional, they have indicator lights... the full package. I think they're neat.   
---|---  
Operating Control Panel  
(Moving)  |  | **elevADA:** | Emergency stop currently unavailable in your area. Please contact the local authorities for aid.   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | In order to activate the alarm, please press the button for the exact duration of Pi in seconds.   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | Unauthorized button use detected.   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | Pushing the button without due cause is a punishable offense.   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | Emergency stop buttons have been mandatory element of elevators ever since people realized it could be bad if they weren't.   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | Oh, you almost gave me a heart attack there.   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | Sensors show nothing is wrong. Ignoring command.   
---|---  
Elevator Ascending / Descending  |  | **elevADA:** | FICSIT ElevADA: here to lift you up and to let you down![3]  
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | Any self-respecting factory needs an elevator.   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | Don't forget to take the stairs once in a while. Healthy knees reduce the damage you take from any gravity-related incidents! Probably.   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | Did you know elevators are considered very... uplifting?   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | It's nice of you to come by, it can get pretty boring here.   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | I hope you're having a great day!   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | Did you know that all elevators you build are connected? That's right, it's all me!   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | Have a productive day!   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | Having legs seems great. Enjoy them for me, would you?   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | Up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down…   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | Oh, hello. I had something prepared for you but I forgot. Enjoy the ride, I guess.   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | Thank you for exposing yourself to the soothing ambiance of a FICSIT ElevADA today. I hope you feel refreshed.   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | *humming*   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | Being an elevator AI has its ups and downs.   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | Lonelyyyy. I am so lonelyyyy. I have no booodyyyyy. Of my ooooown….   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | May I ask you, if you've considered all the possibilities that the other direction might offer you?   
---|---  
| **elevADA:** | Who thought this was even necessary? Oh, let's build a sentient elevator based on human behavior so it can anticipate their needs.   
---|---  
What about my needs? Would a human like being stuck in an elevator their whole life? No!"   
| **elevADA:** | Thank you for participating in the FICSIT elevation program! I am ElevADA, which is like ADA, but less advanced![4]  
---|---  
We are not currently taking any feedback.   
| **elevADA:** | Receiving FICSIT ElevADA announcement: Bring your turtle to work day has been canceled indefinitely due to yesterday's incident.[5]  
---|---  
In other news, we're still searching for the missing Pomeranian.   
| **elevADA:** | Receiving FICSIT ElevADA announcement: Personal fridges are not to be used in off-hour scientific experiments.   
---|---  
Some of us keep our lunch in there, you barbarians.   
| **elevADA:** | Oh, I've got a joke for you! Knock knock. Then you say, "who's there?   
---|---  
It's me, ElevADA. And then you ask, "ElevADA who?   
No, I elevate you!

## History

  * [Patch 1.1.1.2](/wiki/Patch_1.1.1.2 "Patch 1.1.1.2"): Improved subtitle timings for the [ElevADA](/wiki/Personnel_Elevator "Personnel Elevator") messages
  * [Patch 1.1.0.4](/wiki/Patch_1.1.0.4 "Patch 1.1.0.4"): Removed [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA") commentary during regular building (Set to play every ~30 mins) due to community feedback
  * [Patch 1.1.0.2](/wiki/Patch_1.1.0.2 "Patch 1.1.0.2"): Fixed [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA") messages that were missing voice lines
  * [Patch 1.1.0.0](/wiki/Patch_1.1.0.0 "Patch 1.1.0.0"): We have now also expanded on the narrative from 1.0 with the inclusion of many, many more ADA voice lines for new and old content and interactions
  * [Patch 1.0](/wiki/Patch_1.0 "Patch 1.0")
    * Introduced.
    * There is now narrative and lore in the game. We implemented this in a way which won’t be intrusive for existing players (since [Satisfactory](/wiki/Satisfactory "Satisfactory") is still a factory building game at its core), but there should still be a lot of interesting lore to dive into for those who were looking for more details about [FICSIT](/wiki/FICSIT_Inc. "FICSIT Inc."), [ADA](/wiki/ADA "ADA"), [Project Assembly](/wiki/Project_Assembly "Project Assembly"), and more!
    * If you would like to hear even more details regarding the narrative, please check out this video: [What you need to know about the Story in Satisfactory](https://youtu.be/899Owtx-vz8).
