Reason: "_Add unofficial updates_ "

This page serves as a categorized history section for the [multiplayer](/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer") page, due to the large amount of updates that have been released relating to multiplayer. These changes are categorized by the label they were given in the patch notes they were found in. For example, patch notes found in "Bug fixes" categories will be grouped together with the most recent update at the top of the list. 

There have been updates to multiplayer that were not properly announced in patch notes, which means that an official time for when these changes were made cannot be found the majority of the time. These updates will be categorized in the place that best suits what they did to the game, and will have a date included based on when the update is presumed to have been added into the game.
