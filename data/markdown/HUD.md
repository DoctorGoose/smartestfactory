[Satisfactory](/wiki/Satisfactory "Satisfactory")'s HUD 

The **HUD** or **Heads Up Display** is a graphical interface overlaid onto the screen to give the [pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer") information. It includes a cross-hair, compass, hotbar, a list of shortcuts, a health bar, and equipment status.

## Compass

[](/wiki/File:HUD_Compass.png)

[](/wiki/File:HUD_Compass.png "Enlarge")

The compass, showing icons for the HUB, a vehicle, and a beacon.

At the top is the compass, which shows the cardinal directions relative to the [pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer")'s current facing and also indicates the directions of any [vehicles](/wiki/Vehicle "Vehicle") with an icon. It also shows the direction of waypoints from [the HUB](/wiki/The_HUB "The HUB") or [Beacons](/wiki/Beacon "Beacon"). Which [Beacons](/wiki/Beacon "Beacon") are displayed, and at what distance it will show on the compass, can be controlled from the [Map](/wiki/Map "Map")'s [Beacons](/wiki/Beacon "Beacon") menu once unlocked at [Tier 1](/wiki/Tier_1 "Tier 1"). 

  * Take note the cardinal directions are not exactly aligned to the center of each alphabet: E, W, N, and S, instead they are aligned slightly to the left.



## Hotbar

[](/wiki/File:Hotbar.png)

[](/wiki/File:Hotbar.png "Enlarge")

The default hotbar plus a foundation, showing icons to construct power lines, conveyor belts, and a foundation.

At the bottom is the hotbar, which is a list of numbered slots, similar to hotbars found in many other games. Placeable entities such as [vehicles](/wiki/Vehicle "Vehicle") and [buildings](/wiki/Building "Building") can be placed in the slots, allowing them to be selected and placed. For example, if you wish to build conveyor belts without having to enter the build interface every time, you can place them in the hotbar by entering the build menu and hovering over the image of the conveyor belt with the mouse. Then you press a number (1-0) on your keyboard and the conveyor belt will be placed in the corresponding slot on your hotbar. 

The hotbar currently serves for building, emotes, or customizer shortcuts only, it does not interact with the player's inventory. 

There are 10 hotbars. Scroll through them with [`Alt`](/wiki/Controls "Controls")+[](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle")scroll. 

## Shortcuts

[](/wiki/File:Shortcut_list.png)

[](/wiki/File:Shortcut_list.png "Enlarge")

The shortcuts menu, showing several icons and their keyboard shortcuts, with the map still locked.

At the bottom right lists the [shortcut keys](/wiki/Controls "Controls") of several tools. 

    

    [`Q`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") \- [Build menu](/wiki/Build_Gun "Build Gun")

    [`O`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") \- [Codex](/wiki/Codex "Codex")
    [`H`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") \- Hide Equipment | Hide the Currently Building/Dismantling + Building Requirements UI when using [Build Gun](/wiki/Build_Gun "Build Gun") or [Dismantle](/wiki/Dismantle "Dismantle") mode
    [`Tab ↹`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") \- [Inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory")
    [`M`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") \- Open [Map](/wiki/Map "Map") (once unlocked at [Tier 1](/wiki/Tier_1 "Tier 1"), otherwise appears as a blank spot)

## Health and equipment status

[](/wiki/File:HUD_health_n_status.png)

[](/wiki/File:HUD_health_n_status.png "Enlarge")

The Health Status panel, showing health 

At the bottom left is the Pioneer's [health](/wiki/Health "Health") and equipment status. The health bar indicates how many health points the pioneer has, one segment corresponds to 10 health points, with full health at 100 HP (10 segments). 

If any equipment is equipped, a corresponding status bar showing the status of the equipment will appear above the pioneer's health bar: 

  * If fuel is required to operate the tool, the fuel available in inventory will be displayed. 
    * If there is no fuel available, there will be a warning icon indicating that the tool will not work.
    * The [Chainsaw](/wiki/Chainsaw "Chainsaw") stores fuel internally. Body equipment using fuel ([Jetpack](/wiki/Jetpack "Jetpack"), [Gas Mask](/wiki/Gas_Mask "Gas Mask"), [Hazmat Suit](/wiki/Hazmat_Suit "Hazmat Suit")) show a bar with how much is left before another fuel unit will be consumed, or before the equipment will stop operating.
  * If the equipment is stackable, the amount of it in the stack is displayed (consumables, [Parachute](/wiki/Parachute "Parachute"))
  * If driving a wheeled vehicle, the HP of the vehicle will also be shown. If the vehicle HP is depleted, it will disappear. 
    * Vehicle can be [damaged](/wiki/Damage "Damage") by [Spitter](/wiki/Spitter "Spitter")'s or [Alpha Spitter](/wiki/Alpha_Spitter "Alpha Spitter")'s fireball attack.
    * Trains are invincible, they don't have HP.
