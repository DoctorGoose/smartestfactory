Friendly (tameable)

The **Lizard Doggo** is a short reptilian dog-like creature, which can be tamed by the [pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer"). It is widely viewed as the game's mascot after its initial appearance in the [teaser trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlnrnxOCwMg) and was the first and only thing revealed about the game until the [E3 Reveal Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_lmP8jYVLs). Internally it used to be referred to as "Space Rabbit",[1], or "Shrimpy",[2]. but [Coffee Stain Studios](/wiki/Coffee_Stain_Studios "Coffee Stain Studios") have since adopted the community-given[3][4] name "Lizard Doggo" internally.

## Appearance

Lizard Doggos are orange in color, with a white stripe on the underside of the belly, and about the height of a pioneer's knees. The parts of the face surrounding the eyes are also white in color. They have four eyes, long floppy ears, short legs, a shrimp-like tail, and scales on the back resembling a carapace and a distinctive blue tongue. 

## Behavior

Wild Lizard Doggos hold their spines level, maintain a flat expression, and keep rather still when not walking. They wander around their area and occasionally make a bird-like chirping sound, and will also sneeze at random. They are cautious and normally maintain at least 16 meters distance from walking pioneers while looking at the Pioneer, backing away if the Pioneer gets too close. They will flee from a fast-moving Pioneer or a Pioneer that has remained nearby for too long, running in a direction away from the Pioneer. Wild Doggos can be tamed through the use of a [Paleberry](/wiki/Paleberry "Paleberry"), by dropping it on the ground (see Taming below). 

A Lizard Doggo's body language changes dramatically when tamed. Tame Doggos seem to exhibit more dog-like behavior than wild ones: they hold their heads higher, move more, open their eyes wider, pant, and generally appear friendlier and more confident. They display other behavior similar to Earth dogs: they will occasionally scratch their head with a hind foot, then stretch and yawn. They also lick their own eyeballs, like a gecko. They sometimes sit down and look around even when the Pioneer is not nearby. 

Tamed Lizard Doggos enjoy being petted, and will chirp in response, then shake themselves slightly. It is also possible to sneak up to and pat a wild Lizard Doggo, but this will cause it to run away immediately. 

### Taming

  * Doggos are tamed using [Paleberries](/wiki/Paleberries "Paleberries"), which are most easily found in grassy biomes and forests.
  * Before approaching a wild Lizard Doggo, ensure you have a Paleberry ready in your inventory. Open the [Inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory"). Hold down [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right") on the stack of Paleberries and use the popup dialog to split a single one from the stack.
  * Approach the Lizard Doggo. Stop moving when it turns around and starts staring at the player. If you get too close, the Doggo will slowly back away. 
    * If the pioneer moves too fast near the Lizard Doggo, or remains near to it for too long, it will become scared and start running away. Avoid running near the Doggo (press [`⇧ Shift`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to toggle sprinting). It may help to unequip [Blade Runners](/wiki/Blade_Runners "Blade Runners"), if they are equipped. Moving only while crouching may also help.
    * If the Lizard Doggo runs away, follow it at a distance and start again.
  * Drag the one Paleberry out of the Inventory window to drop it on the ground. 
    * Dropping multiple Paleberries as a stack may result in the Doggo eating the entire stack, which is a waste.
    * Splitting the inventory stack before approaching the Lizard Doggo saves time, otherwise the Doggo may run away while you have your inventory open.
    * Be aware that any nearby previously tamed Doggos nearby will also try to eat the berry you drop, unless they are closely following you.
  * Once the Paleberry is dropped, wait until the Doggo comes over and eats the berry. Do not move while this happens.
  * After the Doggo eats the berry, it should jump and chirp, indicating that it is tamed. You may now approach the Doggo and press [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to pet, which allows to you rename it and access its one-slot inventory. 
    * A successfully tamed doggo will jump, smile, and make joyful sounds whenever approached by the Pioneer.
    * If there's no response after it eats the berry, walk away and drop another Paleberry. This is unlikely, but might be necessary if the Doggo was scared previously.
  * It is now safe to sprint and to re-equip Blade Runners (if they were unequipped earlier). Tamed Lizard Doggos will never flee from the Pioneer.



#### Alternate Method

If having difficulties using the intended method above, take note that there is no requirement for the Pioneer to be standing near the berry or the Doggo in order for the Doggo to become tamed. A wild Doggo only has to eat a berry that is left on the ground. 

Just leaving a berry on the ground in an area where a wild Doggo was seen, and waiting until it finds the berry, can be enough for a successful taming. The Pioneer must remain in the general area for this to work, as the game does not load creatures that are too far away. 

A faster method is to drop a berry about 5 to 10 foundations (40 to 80 metres) away, and then approach the Doggo from the opposite direction so that it runs away from you towards the berry. You should see the Doggo change direction and run directly to the berry to eat it once it gets close enough to see it (as long as you are not close enough to keep scaring the Doggo). 

### Companionship and care

For the safety of a Lizard Doggo, confining it within a pen is recommended, as they will roam at random when left alone and may run into poison clouds, get stuck in terrain, or simply become lost. A simple pen can be made using a [Foundation](/wiki/Foundation "Foundation") with surrounding [Walls](/wiki/Walls "Walls") and a ceiling, or through four [Walkway Turns](/wiki/Walkway "Walkway"). The Lizard Doggo, unable to jump over one meter, will attempt to follow the player but will begin wandering if the distance becomes too great. Upon the player's return, the Doggo shows joy by jumping and wagging its ears. Keep in mind, Lizard Doggos struggle to keep up with fast-moving players, particularly those using [Blade Runners](/wiki/Blade_Runners "Blade Runners"). A doggo can keep up with a player walking in Blade Runners, but will be left behind by a sprinting player. 

Lizard Doggos can be killed by the player, [poison gas](/wiki/Poison_Gas "Poison Gas"), running over with a vehicle, and from falling too far. While hostile creatures do not directly attack Lizard Doggos, attacks aimed at the Pioneer are capable of killing Lizard Doggos unfortunate enough to be in the line of attack. Avoid combat, toxic clouds and great heights with Lizard Doggos around. It does not drop any items on death. 

Like any other creature that is killed, a Lizard Doggo that dies will eventually respawn at its spawn point (for tame Doggos, this will be close to where it was originally tamed). It will then need to be found and tamed again. A Doggo may not be able to respawn if you have buildings too close to its spawn point.

### Generating items

Tamed Lizard Doggos can be kept in a [makeshift farm](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/ccq5uv/who_wants_to_be_a_shard_farmer/) to gather items frequently. Their location or proximity to the player have no effect on the items they find. 

Tamed Lizard Doggos with no items in their inventory have a 0.2% chance each second of "finding" an item. This means that the average time it takes for a Lizard Doggo to find an item is usually around 500 seconds (8.33 minutes). 

When a Tamed Lizard Doggo finds an item, a fixed quantity of one of the following items appears in its inventory:

Within the Lizard Doggo's inventory, the items are generated out of thin air: they do not remove any items from the world. For example, when a Doggo generates a Blue Power Slug, the number of Blue Power Slugs on the map will not decrease. This makes Lizard Doggos the only way of obtaining additional Power Slugs beyond the number that are found in the world. While collecting slugs from Lizard Doggos does theoretically give the player access to unlimited Power Shards, a much easier and automatable method for unlimited Power Shards (the Synthetic Power Shard alternate recipe) becomes usable at Tier 9 and can be researched in the MAM. 

Assuming each of the 47 items has an equal probability of being brought, the average Sink point value gotten from recycling it would be about 87079. If you could take the item from the lizard doggo's inventory instantly, you could reach an idealistic average of 174.16 Sink points per second per doggo (10450/min/doggo; 626,976/h/doggo). 

For getting Power Slugs under the same assumption of equal chance, it is 1/47 for each slug to be brought so 3/47 items are slugs - converted to 8 Power Shards per 47 items on average. With 500s per item per doggo, it is about 1 shard per 2938s per doggo or 7833s for any of the 3 slug types per doggo. 

The Lizard Doggo can also be used as a mule of sorts, as the single inventory slot can be used to store an item. However, this requires traveling at the Lizard Doggo's comparatively slow pace and carries a significant risk of losing the Doggo and the item along with it. 

Since Lizard Doggos are available right from the start of the game and occasionally deliver very complex late-game items, they can provide a large starting bonanza of [FICSIT Coupons](/wiki/FICSIT_Coupon "FICSIT Coupon"). 

## Tips

  * Lizard Doggos do not receive any damage from the [](/wiki/Boom_Box "Boom Box") [Boom Box](/wiki/Boom_Box "Boom Box") Turbobass™️ but still get moved by the shockwave, resulting in the ideal way of transporting them on short distances over rough terrain. It is not recommended to move multiple of them at once this way because after being pushed they immediately attempt to walk back to the player. If you need to separate a pack of Lizard Doggos, you can use the Boom Box Turbobass™️ in the middle of it.

## Trivia

  * Lizard Doggo's name comes from the combination of its scaly appearance which suggests that it is some sort of reptile, but its behavior is comparable to that of a domestic dog. 
    * "Doggo" is an informal affectionate term for a dog. It was initially used jokingly but made its way into the game itself.
    * The name "Lizard Doggo" was originally coined by YouTube commenter Chad Mojito[3].[4]
  * The Lizard Doggo is available to buy as a plush.[5][6]
    * The official merchandise website (which sells these plushies) is named [lizarddoggo.com](http://lizarddoggo.com), even though the site is not limited to Satisfactory (it also sells merch for other games published by Coffee Stain, namely Valheim and Deep Rock Galactic).
  * Lizard Doggos are supposed to be a cross of a rabbit and a shrimp that acts like a dog.
  * According to the box in which Lizard Doggo plushes are packed in, their binomial nomenclature is _Lapogonamorpha Canistacea,_ which originates from four parts: 
    * Lagomorpha - Rabbits
    * Pogona - Bearded dragons
    * Canis - Dogs and wolves
    * Crustacean - Shrimp and other decapods
  * Lizard Doggos can ride on top of [Trains](/wiki/Train "Train") or [Trucks](/wiki/Truck "Truck") the same way pioneers can, which can be especially useful for transporting them long-distance.
  * The "real-life" Lizard Doggo featured in the [Update 4](/wiki/Update_4 "Update 4") patch notes video reused one of the animations from the [GDC 2018 Teaser Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlnrnxOCwMg).[7] It was killed by [Snutt](/wiki/Snutt "Snutt") with DrawingXaos' poster tube,[8][9] a fact that Snutt has since repeatedly denied.[10][11]
  * On April 1, 2021, the April Fools Special Event was introduced. This event was repeated on April 1, 2022. During both events the Lizard Doggos appeared larger, and some Lizard Doggos appeared wearing the [Pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer") helmet.
  * Lizard Doggo milk is highly combustible.[12]
  * The default name for a newly tamed Lizard Doggo is "DoggoWithLongName". It is not clear if this was intended to be the default name, or if it was accidentally left in the game after Coffee Stain testing to ensure that the new (at the time) Lizard Doggo user interface could handle long names with no spaces, but it was never changed in any subsequent patches.
  * Despite repeated questions, it has not yet been confirmed whether or not Lizard Doggos have buttholes, a cloaca, or indeed any semblance of a digestive tract.[digestive-tract 1][digestive-tract 2][digestive-tract 3][digestive-tract 4][digestive-tract 5][digestive-tract 6][digestive-tract 7][digestive-tract 8][digestive-tract 9][digestive-tract 10][digestive-tract 11]



## Current issues

  * Lizard Doggos can easily fall off high ledges, including elevated foundations, and die from [fall damage](/wiki/Fall_damage "Fall damage"). Avoid keeping them in high places.
  * Lizard Doggos can sometimes suddenly disappear when kept in an enclosure or pen. It happens when the player goes on an expedition for a longer time or moves too far away from the location. The risk of losing the pets is very high when the enclosure is on the ground without a foundation.[13][14][15]
    * When your Lizard Doggo disappears due to lack of a foundation, you can still see it in the satisfactory calculator when you upload the save. By looking at the location of the Lizard Doggo you can see that is has fallen to a position very far below the ground. By clicking the doggo and choosing "update Lizard Doggo position" you can edit the coordinates to get it back on the surface. Check a nearby building to see how high you should place it. If you place it too high it will fall and die.[16]
    * If you prefer a natural floor for your lizard doggo pen, use the Lock Hologram feature to nudge foundations just barely underneath the ground. This should be enough to prevent Lizard Doggos from falling through the terrain. Be aware that you will not be able to delete these foundations again once they are fully underground, without using tools like the Satisfactory Calculator site.
  * Their pathfinding will often result in them getting stuck on small protrusions and moving directly sideways along obstacles.
  * Tamed Lizard Doggos may stop moving after an extended time, no longer recognizing or following the Pioneer. If this occurs, it can be fixed by reloading the session.



## Media appearances

  * It occupies the entirety of the [teaser trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlnrnxOCwMg) and can be seen attempting to eat a [paleberry](/wiki/Paleberry "Paleberry"), while construction work can be heard and shadows and lights can be seen coming from behind the camera.
  * In the [E3 Reveal Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_lmP8jYVLs) it can briefly be seen riding a conveyor belt at 1:48.
  * It also made its appearance at the end of the Update 3 trailer.
  * It occupies a large portion of the Update 5 trailer and is seen stealing the Pioneer's build gun at the end.
  * It has continued to make appearances in many trailer videos and media releases, too numerous to list here.
