## Intro

What's up! 

Update 4 is now finally available on Early Access! This update is jam-packed with new content! So let me break it down for y'all! 

If you're looking for the complete patch notes of the update then scroll to the bottom of the post! 

### Drones

Transporting things on conveyor belts is cool and all - but transporting things using drones is indisputably better, so we added that. Still, they wouldn’t let me stand on them though on account that it could interfere with the drone’s avionics. I don’t blame ‘em. [Drones](/wiki/Drone "Drone") are designed for long-range, low-capacity transportation and unlocks in [tier 7](/wiki/Tier_7 "Tier 7") & [8](/wiki/Tier_8 "Tier 8"). The drones are fully automated, traveling between two fixed ports and navigating themselves around any obstacles they encounter along the way. Each [port](/wiki/Drone_Port "Drone Port") can only contain one drone but they move across the map extremely quickly and are far easier to set up than [Trains](/wiki/Electric_Locomotive "Electric Locomotive"), [Belts](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt "Conveyor Belt"), or [Trucks](/wiki/Truck "Truck"). Drones require [batteries](/wiki/Battery "Battery") as fuel and their consumption rate and travel speed become more efficient as delivery distances increase. They can’t carry much, but they’re doing their best. 

### Hover pack and Ziplines

But drones aren’t the only thing flying around! There’s new equipment pioneers from [FICSIT Inc.](/wiki/FICSIT_Inc. "FICSIT Inc.") can also utilize such as the brand-new hover pack to get a good overview of their production lines and build from a higher vantage point! [Hover packs](/wiki/Hover_Pack "Hover Pack") draws power from the power grid and doesn’t require any extra fuel to function. However, they’re not the fastest way to get around and explore with, but not everything’s a competition. In addition to this there’s also a new tool called the [zipline](/wiki/Zipline "Zipline"), used to zip around your power poles in your base! 

### Nuclear Power & New Buildings

We’ve extended the [nuclear](/wiki/Nuclear_Power_Plant "Nuclear Power Plant") refinement processing the game to be able to produce [Plutonium Fuel Rods](/wiki/Plutonium_Fuel_Rod "Plutonium Fuel Rod"). Not only that but there’s also a bunch of new buildings in the update that play an integral part in some of the nuclear production lines such as the blender, the particle accelerator, and the resource well pressurizer & extractor. But also, some that will improve the existing aspects of the game such as the power storage and power switch. 

  * [Blender](/wiki/Blender "Blender")



The Blender combines up to 2 fluid and 2 solid resources, and therefore earns its name of next level fluid related production. After unlocking the Nuclear Power milestone in Tier 8, the Blender can be used to refine [Uranium](/wiki/Uranium "Uranium") straight into [Encased Uranium Cells](/wiki/Encased_Uranium_Cell "Encased Uranium Cell"). Further down the line, the previously useless [Uranium Waste](/wiki/Uranium_Waste "Uranium Waste") can now be refined into [Plutonium Fuel Rods](/wiki/Plutonium_Fuel_Rod "Plutonium Fuel Rod") for even more power generation. 

  * [Particle Accelerator](/wiki/Particle_Accelerator "Particle Accelerator")



This spectacular machine puts the power of matter conversion and generation into your hands. It is the last part of the nuclear production chain, and is used to create both [Plutonium Pellets](/wiki/Plutonium_Pellet "Plutonium Pellet") and [Nuclear Pasta](/wiki/Nuclear_Pasta "Nuclear Pasta")

  * [Resource Well Pressurizer & Extractor](/wiki/Resource_Well_Pressurizer "Resource Well Pressurizer")



[Nitrogen](/wiki/Nitrogen_Gas "Nitrogen Gas") is the first gas added to Satisfactory. It functions like other fluids except that it doesn't require [pumps](/wiki/Pipeline_Pump "Pipeline Pump") to be moved through pipes. We've also added [Resource Wells](/wiki/Resource_Well "Resource Well"), a new resource spot that can be tapped with the Pressurizer. Depending on the Resource well, they can give access to Nitrogen Gas, [Oil](/wiki/Crude_Oil "Crude Oil") and [Water](/wiki/Water "Water"). 

  * [Power Storage](/wiki/Power_Storage "Power Storage")



These bad boys will store excess power and distribute it back into the grid when needed. Use them to balance out dynamic power generation and consumption. 

  * [Power Switch](/wiki/Power_Switch "Power Switch")



The power switch gives you more control over your circuits! You can now separate circuits, turning them off and on at a whim and you can name them too! Or you can just use them as signs until we add that to the game in the near future. Soon™. 

### Lights

Last but not least, one of the most requested features to the game is [lights](/wiki/Lights "Lights")! Now your factory can be brighter than my future! There are 3 different types of lights; there are ceiling lights, flood light towers and wall mounted flood lights! You can also set the intensity and color of the lights! 

There's also new parts & resources,as well as new alternative recipes and project parts! Not to mention a ton of optimizations, bug fixes, UI improvements, QoL features, [Multiplayer](/wiki/Multiplayer "Multiplayer") fixes, and more! You can learn all about them in the patch notes below! 

## New content
