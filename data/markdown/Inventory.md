## Unlocking

The inventory is unlocked after opening the [Codex](/wiki/Codex "Codex") for the first time. 

## Control

While the inventory is open the player can perform various functions by clicking on an item in the inventory. 

Function  | Keyboard / Mouse  | Notes / Other Functions   
---|---|---  
Stack Transfer  | [`⇧ Left Shift`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") \+ [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") | Items can be quickly transferred as a stack to/from the inventory.   
Mass Transfer  | [`Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") and drag  
[`Ctrl`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") \+ [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") | All items of the same type will be transferred to/from the inventory.   
Splitting Stacks  | [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right") | Will split a stack in half. Holding down [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Right.png "Right") brings up a menu that allows splitting off specific amounts, either by using the slider or manual input. The menu also has a button to see the item's entry in the [Codex](/wiki/Codex "Codex").   
Sorting  | [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") | Inventories (including storage buildings) have a button to sort all items.   
Hotbar  | None  | Items in the inventory can't go into the [Hotbar](/wiki/HUD#Hotbar "HUD") (only [Vehicles](/wiki/Vehicle "Vehicle") and [Buildings](/wiki/Building "Building") can)   
  
### Relevant items

  * When viewing a [Buildings](/wiki/Buildings "Buildings") UI, and if there are items relevant to a recipe or overclocking, the first 10 will be shown above the current inventory, and be inserted using [`1`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to [`0`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") into the buildings Input Buffer Slot or Overclocking Slot.
  * Building that don't use a recipe or can not be overclocked don't show relevant items above inventory.



#### Example usage

[](/wiki/File:Relevant_Items_hotkey.png)  
In the above example, 

  * [`Keypad 1`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") will transfer [Modular Frames](/wiki/Modular_Frame "Modular Frame") to the [Manufacturer](/wiki/Manufacturer "Manufacturer").
  * [`Keypad 2`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") or [`3`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") will transfer [Steel Pipes](/wiki/Steel_Pipe "Steel Pipe") to the Manufacturer.
  * [`Keypad 4`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") will do nothing, since the Manufacturer is full of [Encased Industrial Beams](/wiki/Encased_Industrial_Beam "Encased Industrial Beam") in that slot.
  * [`Keypad 5`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") or [`6`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") or [`7`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") will transfer [Screws](/wiki/Screw "Screw") to the Manufacturer.
  * [`Keypad 8`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") or [`9`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") will do nothing, as you can't transfer items to the output slot using shortcuts. You can, however, drag items into it.
  * [`Keypad 0`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") will insert one [Power Shard](/wiki/Power_Shard "Power Shard") into the Power Shard slot for [overclocking](/wiki/Overclock "Overclock").
  * The 11th and 12th relevant item slots do not have shortcut keys.
