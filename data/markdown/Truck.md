The **Truck** (aka **"The Unit"**) is a 6-wheeled land [vehicle](/wiki/Vehicle "Vehicle") which can be used to transport large amounts of cargo on land. It can be either driven by the [pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer") or automated. It has a higher maximum speed than and twice the storage capacity of the [Tractor](/wiki/Tractor "Tractor"), and can ford deeper water without getting stuck. However, due to being very heavy, it can end up being a slower transportation option than the Tractor. It has a tight turning circle thanks to its counter-steering rear wheels. 

The Truck can drift with the handbrake [`Space`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), just as the [Explorer](/wiki/Explorer "Explorer"). Unlike Tractors, Trucks are unable to knock down [plants and small vegetation](/wiki/Tree "Tree") blocking their ways, which can make Trucks unreliable sometimes.

## Usage

_Main article:_[Vehicles](/wiki/Vehicles "Vehicles")

The Truck's inventory can be accessed by interacting with a door at the rear of the vehicle, where it can also be fueled by inputting up to a stack of fuel into the fuel slot. All [Fuels](/wiki/Fuels "Fuels") are accepted, ranging from [](/wiki/Leaves "Leaves") [Leaves](/wiki/Leaves "Leaves") to [](/wiki/Plutonium_Fuel_Rod "Plutonium Fuel Rod") [Plutonium Fuel Rods](/wiki/Plutonium_Fuel_Rod "Plutonium Fuel Rod"). Fuels with more energy last longer, but do not provide any additional benefits. Additionally, a built-in [Craft Bench](/wiki/Craft_Bench "Craft Bench") can be accessed using a tab at the top of the same menu. 

Once fueled, entering the Truck allows it to be driven. Running out of fuel while driving prevents accelerating and braking. Automated routes can be recorded using the self-driving menu [`Q`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). 

Despite its huge wheels and complex suspension system, it performs poorly as an off-road vehicle. It can not climb hills as easily as the Tractor or Explorer. It is the biggest road vehicle in the game, which means that it might not fit through small gaps that you might encounter while exploring the [world](/wiki/World "World"). The suspension system is rather buggy, which can result in the Truck becoming stuck or being launched when driven across very rough terrain. As mentioned before, it also cannot knock down small foliage blocking its path. 

The Truck can climb both 2m ramps and 4m ramps in both manual and automated drive. It is almost exactly as wide as one foundation, so make sure any roads you build have lanes that are at least one and a half foundations wide.

## Achievements

[](/wiki/Achievements "Achievements")**[Establish dominance](/wiki/Achievements#Establish_dominance "Achievements")** •  _"Hit a creature with a vehicle."_

[](/wiki/Achievements "Achievements")**[Look both ways next time](/wiki/Achievements#Look_both_ways_next_time "Achievements")** •  _"Get knocked over by a vehicle."_

[](/wiki/Achievements "Achievements")**[Too fast, Too factory](/wiki/Achievements#Too_fast,_Too_factory "Achievements")** •  _"Move faster than 140 km/h."_

## Current issues

  * The wheels and suspensions can easily be pushed by the [pioneer](/wiki/Pioneer "Pioneer"), causing the truck to move or even flip over.[1]
  * When constructed on top of other vehicles or non-flat objects, the truck will usually get propelled high into the air.[2]
    * [Tractors](/wiki/Tractor "Tractor") display similar behavior when crashing into other vehicles at high speeds.

## Early game development

Prior to Closed Alpha, in Sprint 12 (week 24) the first vehicle, a Truck, was seen and had a basic but developed design.
