**Conveyor Lifts** are structures used to transport items between buildings or floors. They are the vertical counterpart to [Conveyor Belts](/wiki/Conveyor_Belts "Conveyor Belts"). Unlike belts, they can exist standalone.

## Characteristics

Just like Conveyor Belts, once a Conveyor Lift is connected to a [building](/wiki/Building "Building"), it will begin to pull items out from the building's output slot or attempt to push items into its input slot. Items on lifts cannot be picked up nor manually dispensed onto one. 

If the lift cannot output its items, the items will back up in it. 

Each mark has higher throughput (measured in items/min) than its predecessor, and also appears more visually advanced.

## Construction

[](/wiki/File:Tall_Conveyor_Lift.png)

[](/wiki/File:Tall_Conveyor_Lift.png "Enlarge")

When built between 2 Conveyor Lift Floor Holes, the height limit of 48 meter can be bypassed. A 200 meter tall lift (right) compared to a 48 meter tall lift (left).

The building of a lift always starts with its starting point--i.e., the point objects are being transported from--and ends with its ending point. During construction, pressing [`R`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") to change the build mode will reverse the lift's direction, unless it's fixed by connecting it to a building input/output or another conveyor. 

  * The height of one lift is limited to 48 meters, but multiple lifts can be attached to each other, allowing for theoretically infinitely tall lift chains.
  * A Conveyor lift built between 2 Conveyor Lift Floor Holes can bypass the 48 meter limit, granting it infinite vertical height (which is then limited by world's height of 2.247 km).



The rotation of the 'head' can be changed by scrolling [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Middle.png "Middle"). Use mouse movement to change its height - it can go up or down in increments of one meter. The minimum vertical distance is four meters and the maximum is 48 meters. Similar to Conveyor Belts, Conveyor Lifts can be upgraded in-place. 

The building cost is 1 x base cost per meter, but the height used in calculating the cost is rounded up to the nearest even integer. For example, a Mk.1 lift base cost is 2 iron plates. At height of 9m or 10m, the cost is 10 iron plates. At height of 47 or 48m, the cost is 48 iron plates. Etc. 

### Connectivity

To check a Conveyor Lift's connectivity, look at the shape of its flexible connectors:

[](/wiki/File:Conveyor_Lift_Connectivity.png)

[](/wiki/File:Conveyor_Lift_Connectivity.png "Enlarge")

**Blue** : The connector flexes out, indicating it is connected. **Red** : The connector retracts, showing no connection

  * The Conveyor Lift must be built _after_ the structure it is connected to. For example, building a [Conveyor Splitter](/wiki/Conveyor_Splitter "Conveyor Splitter") after building the lift will not work. Otherwise, small belts may be used to connect the lifts.
  * Conveyor Lifts can be built between a Splitter and a machine (e.g., [Assembler](/wiki/Assembler "Assembler")) directly, without the need for a short belt, provided the distances in-between are correct. The [Nuclear Power Plant](/wiki/Nuclear_Power_Plant "Nuclear Power Plant") is an exception, as the input and output are both offset by half a meter in relation to Foundation grids, making it impossible to align the gap with Splitters. A short belt is required in this case.
  * The starting point of the lift snaps to an existing Belt, but the ending point does not ("Encroaching others clearance"). In either case, the flexible connector appears to be retracted.



### Vertical Splitter and Vertical Merger

[Version 1.1](/wiki/Patch_1.1.0.0 "Patch 1.1.0.0") added ability to place [Splitters](/wiki/Splitter "Splitter") _(which become**Vertical Splitters**)_ and [Mergers](/wiki/Merger "Merger") _(which become**Vertical Mergers**)_ to Conveyor Lifts allowing more modularity to your vertical builds. 

Splitters or Mergers will attach to both the Input or Output of a Conveyor Lift, as well to any point in-between. 

## Tips

  * [Power Poles](/wiki/Power_Poles "Power Poles") can be placed on the end segments of lifts.
  * When trying to connect a lift to a machine you can hear the special sound when rotating or changing height. That sound means the new lift will be connected properly.
  * When connecting a machine to a [](/wiki/Conveyor_Lift_Floor_Hole "Conveyor Lift Floor Hole") [Conveyor Lift Floor Hole](/wiki/Conveyor_Lift_Floor_Hole "Conveyor Lift Floor Hole") it is easier to start from the machine and aim for the Floor Hole.
