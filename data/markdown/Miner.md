A **Miner** is a type of resource extractor that automatically extracts [solid resources](/wiki/Category:Ores "Category:Ores") when built or placed on top of a [Resource Node](/wiki/Resource_Node "Resource Node"). There are 4 types of miners available: **Portable Miner** , **Miner Mk.1** , **Miner Mk.2** and **Miner Mk.3**. 

Portable Miner (see below) is an [equipment](/wiki/Equipment "Equipment") that has to be held in the hand slot to be placed on a Resource Node. Multiple Portable Miners can be placed on the same node, as long as there is space for them. 

Miner buildings (mark 1 to 3) are constructed with the [Build Gun](/wiki/Build_Gun "Build Gun") instead. Only one Miner building can be built on a Resource Node, and the Resource Node must be free of obstruction caused by [Resource Deposit](/wiki/Deposit "Deposit") or crackable [boulders](/wiki/Boulder "Boulder"). Miner buildings require [power](/wiki/Power "Power") to operate. They output mined resources to a connected [Conveyor Belt](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt "Conveyor Belt"), which allows the process to be fully automated.

## Building

### Building placement

  * Scan for the target Resource Node with [Resource Scanner](/wiki/Resource_Scanner "Resource Scanner") [`V`](/wiki/Controls "Controls").
  * Manually mine [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") out the resource [deposit](/wiki/Deposit "Deposit") on top of the node, if present. If cracked [boulders](/wiki/Boulder "Boulder") are present, remove them with a [Nobelisk Detonator](/wiki/Nobelisk_Detonator "Nobelisk Detonator").
  * Place the Miner down. Connect [Conveyor Belt](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt "Conveyor Belt") and [Power Line](/wiki/Power_Line "Power Line").
  * Only one Miner can be built on each [Resource Node](/wiki/Resource_Node "Resource Node").



### Building upgrades

  * Once the higher tier of Miners are unlocked, you can upgrade (and downgrade, if you wish) the existing Miner in-place.
  * Aim the hologram of the higher-mark Miner at the existing Miner and [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") to upgrade it.
  * The [Power Line](/wiki/Power_Line "Power Line") and [Conveyor Belt](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt "Conveyor Belt") connected to it will remain connected. However, its stored ores and [Power Shards](/wiki/Power_Shard "Power Shard") will be returned to the pioneer's [Inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory"). 
    * Take note when upgrading a Uranium miner, as the [Uranium](/wiki/Uranium "Uranium") ore is strongly [radioactive](/wiki/Radioactive "Radioactive") when carried.
    * A [Conveyor Lift](/wiki/Conveyor_Lift "Conveyor Lift") directly connected to a Miner will become disconnected after the Miner upgrade, observe the flexible connector of the lift become retracted as an indication. Rebuild the Conveyor Lift.
  * In case the pioneer's Inventory is full when upgrading the Miner, the returned material will still be stored in the Dismantle [Crate](/wiki/Crate "Crate"), which will be hidden below the Miner. Dismantle the Miner to find it.
  * You will still need to have the required number of Portable Miners in your inventory when upgrading, despite them also being a part of the returned parts.



### Foundations

A Miner can be built on a Resource Node even if the entire node is covered by [Foundations](/wiki/Foundations "Foundations"). This does not apply to Portable Miners. 

  * This is provided the foundations laid are not too high above the Resource Node.
  * If desired to cover foundations higher, consider using corner ramps as they lack collision box, and thus allow clipping.
  * If covering foundations are higher and the miner is unable to find the node, alternatively to placing corner ramps, place foundations while leaving any portion of the node visible. When placing the miner, point your gun at the node and the miner should be placed at the appropriate height.



### Starting time

A Miner, once it receives power, requires 10 seconds to start up. During the startup period, it consumes power, but no ore will be mined. 

### Mining speed

`(Mining Speed) in items/min = (Purity Modifier) * (([Overclock](/wiki/Overclock "Overclock") percentage) / 100) * (Default Mining Speed) items/min`  
where  
`Purity Modifier: Impure = 0.5, Normal = 1, Pure = 2` and  
`Default Mining Speed: Mk.1 = 60, Mk.2 = 120, Mk.3 = 240`

  * Mining speed can also be set by typing a desired number in the "parts per minute" under the "Target production rate:" instead of the sliding bar, or percentage.

  * Same mining speed applies to all kinds of Resource Nodes, such as [Iron Ore](/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore"), [Copper Ore](/wiki/Copper_Ore "Copper Ore"), up to [Uranium](/wiki/Uranium "Uranium"), and [Bauxite](/wiki/Bauxite "Bauxite").



### Overclocking

_Main article:_[ Tutorial:Advanced clock speed > Clock speed for miners and extractors](/wiki/Tutorial:Advanced_clock_speed#Clock_speed_for_miners_and_extractors "Tutorial:Advanced clock speed")

Miners can be [overclocked](/wiki/Overclock "Overclock") up to 250% speed, at the cost of greatly increased [power](/wiki/Power "Power") consumption. 

Power Consumption by Miners vs Overclocking Speed (MW)  Miner | 50 % | 100 % | 150 % | 200 % | 250 %   
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Miner Mk.1 | 2.0 | 5.0 | 8.5 | 12.5 | 16.8   
Miner Mk.2 | 6.0 | 15.0 | 25.6 | 37.5 | 50.4   
Miner Mk.3 | 18.0 | 45.0 | 76.9 | 112.5 | 151.1   
  
When aiming for a higher mining rate, overclocking is preferred over using higher tier miners. In any case, power consumption isn't much different between all three kinds of miners: 

  * Running a Miner Mk.2 at 100% has the same mining rate as a Miner Mk.1 at 200% with increased energy consumption (15 MW instead of 12.5 MW).
  * Running a Miner Mk.3 at 50% has the same mining rate as a Miner Mk.1 at 200% with increased energy consumption (18 MW instead of 12.5 MW).
  * Running a Miner Mk.3 at 100% has the same mining rate as a Miner Mk.2 at 200% with increased energy consumption (45 MW instead of 37.5 MW).



### Miner Mk.3 extraction limit

The Miner Mk.3 can produce 1,200 units per minute on a pure Resource Node when overclocked to 250%.

A **Portable Miner** is a small, portable version of a Miner. As the first available mining machine, it is used to semi-automate the mining process in the early-game. It can be crafted at the [Equipment Workshop](/wiki/Equipment_Workshop "Equipment Workshop") after completing the [Tier 0](/wiki/Tier_0 "Tier 0") Milestone - HUB Upgrade 1. It requires no fuel nor power. It has no [Conveyor Belt](/wiki/Conveyor_Belt "Conveyor Belt") connections which means its mining process cannot be fully automated.

### Mining speed

A Portable Miner mines at a speed of 20, 40, and 80 items per minute for impure, normal, and pure nodes respectively. 

### Dismantle

As a Portable Miner is considered as equipment, not a building, you cannot dismantle it with [`F`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). Manually approach it [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") and press the 'Pick Up Miner' button to remove it, including its contents. 

### Usage

Open the inventory [`Tab ↹`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") and Double [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") the Portable Miner to equip it in hand. Then find a Resource Node with the [Resource Scanner](/wiki/Resource_Scanner "Resource Scanner") [`V`](/wiki/Controls "Controls"), such as an [Iron Ore](/wiki/Iron_Ore "Iron Ore") node. At any location on the deposit where you have the prompt to pick up ore, [](/wiki/File:Keyboard_White_Mouse_Left.png "Left") to deploy the miner. It will display a deploy animation but will begin mining as soon as it leaves your hand. 

It holds a maximum of one [stack](/wiki/Stack "Stack") of [ore](/wiki/Ore "Ore") (100). When it is full, it will stop mining. To have it start mining again, interact [`E`](/wiki/Controls "Controls") with it and click 'Grab All' to remove the ore from its inventory. 

It is advised to place several Portable Miners in an arc shape so that the pioneer is not required to move around when interacting with the next portable miner. As soon as the [](/wiki/Storage_Container "Storage Container") [Storage Container](/wiki/Storage_Container "Storage Container") is unlocked, build it next to the mining site for ore-buffering. 

Although Portable Miners are primarily an early-game tool, they can still find some use in mid-game situations to allow semi-automated collection of far-away Resource Nodes, without the player having to set up power lines or resource transport to those nodes.

## Tips

  * The Automated Miner alternate uses more valuable materials than the manual recipe. Since there are a finite number of resource nodes to build Miners on (and a finite amount of space to place Portable Miners on, if you need to amass raw resources), it may not be worth automating their production and instead manually crafting them whenever they are needed.



## Trivia

  * When opening the Portable Miner's inventory there is a small chance that the name of the item will be misspelled (written as "Portobello Miner") in the top left corner of the UI
