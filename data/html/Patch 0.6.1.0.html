  Hi Pioneers!
Our longest Experimental period so far is ending. Update 6 has made its way onto the Early Access branch! Some of you already know all about what we’ve added and changed, but for everyone else we will go over it in detail one more time.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the old saying goes: A trailer on YouTube says more than a thousand patch notes, so definitely check out the Update 6 trailer before you continue reading. While it contains substantially less information than the actual patch notes, it comes with a little surprise:
  <a class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/U_K6QiUaenQ" rel="nofollow">
   https://youtu.be/U_K6QiUaenQ
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  While we have your attention, a little PSA: As we move on to our next development goals, we will be spending some time to wrap up remaining issues with Update 6. You can help us with that by reporting any issues and sending us feedback via our QA Site:
  <a class="external free" href="https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/" rel="nofollow">
   https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  Some content that we briefly had on Experimental hasn’t made it to Early Access quite yet. Specifically, there are several Wall options that we are hopefully bringing to Early Access with a little delay to make sure their quality is on par and to prevent us from breaking anything related to these walls. If you have suggestions on what Satisfactory is still missing, you can also look at the QA Site for that. Upvote anything that you agree with and add new feature suggestions if you can’t find what you are looking for. It’s the best place to let us know about these things!
 </p>
 <p>
  Now let’s take our final look at Early Access Update 6: It shines with some major world updates, the Boom Box, impactful changes to Equipment and the MAM progression, several great quality of life updates on the UI side of all things Satisfactory, a full overhaul of our creature AI system, and some under-the-hood changes of major systems. We break all of this down in more detail below.
 </p>
 <p>
  We hope you all will have a fantastic time with the new content and changes. Looking forward to be hearing from you!
 </p>
 <p>
  Cheers from the Satisfactory Team &lt;3

 <h3>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="Spire_Coast">
   Spire Coast
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  This is probably the most significant single biome change that we still had in the pipeline, and now it is here: The island paradise that is the Spire Coast. We’re very excited to see what you will build in this area, constricted (and hopefully inspired) by the verticality of the spires. There are still oil nodes in the area, but their locations have changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  We also managed to do a full visual update of the cliff wall separating the Spire Coast from the Dune Desert, so that large empty plateau is finally ready to be built on as well.
 </p>
 <h3>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="Swamp">
   Swamp
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Swamp has received a full vegetation and atmosphere overhaul to better represent the icky vision we have for it. A place for daring pioneers to test their mettle in the future.

  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  We haven’t been idle on these high impact world topics either, with a generally improved day and night sky, clouds, and the addition of rainy weather. Hopefully you’ll enjoy the new variety as a myriad of days pass on Massage-2(AB)b.
 </p>
 <p>
  The overall changes to our atmosphere system have also been put to use with more specific tweaks of the updated areas mentioned above, as well as some of our starting areas: Dune Desert, Northern Forest and Grass Fields. We’ve adjusted the specific lighting, fog, and feel for all those places.
 </p>
 <h2>

  </span>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="Hand_Equipment_&amp;_Ammunition">
   Hand Equipment &amp; Ammunition
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  The most obvious content is the addition of different ammunition types for all the Pioneers ranged weaponry. It’s quite a wide range of new useful and dangerous tools, from utility options like the Pulse Nobelisk to advanced homing ammunition for the rifle. And there is a mini nuke, which honestly is a terrible idea in the best way.
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ve also improved the UI feedback for switching through your hand slots, making it easier to identify quickly which gadget or weapon you are switching to, and we finally implement a Holster interaction to put away your current hand equipment.
 </p>
 <h3>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="MAM_Progression">
   MAM Progression
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  We integrated the new ammunition types throughout different research trees in the MAM and did some rebalancing and reshuffling in the process! On revisiting them you’ll find that costs and placement might have changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  A major change in terms of general progression is that we’ve moved some of the most popular energy related alternate recipes to standard MAM unlocks. Now you can find both Turbo Fuel and Compacted Coal there, as they are a great addition to the general power progression of the game.
 </p>
 <h3>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="Multiple_Body_Equipment_Slots">
   Multiple Body Equipment Slots
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Update 6 introduces the ability to equip almost all existing Body Equipment at the same time. Instead of a single slot, we now have a slot each for: Head, body, back, and legs. The main progression for Body Equipment is now that you can combine them as they get unlocked and you’ll only have to switch your back Equipment between the Jetpack, Hoverpack, and Parachute depending on your preference and the situation.
 </p>
 <h3>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="Boom_Box">
   Boom Box
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Brand new for the Early Access release is the Boom Box! It’s featured in the trailer and allows you to play some tunes for yourself or with friends while going about your business in Satisfactory. The Boom Box and several tapes can be unlocked in the AWESOME Shop, and you can even find a few hidden tapes in the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Boom Box also comes with a Turbo Bass feature, which goes a little bit beyond playing tapes. Get it from the shop and try it out!

  <span class="mw-headline" id="Mostly_visual_updates">

 </h3>
 <p>
  The most major change you will be able to find here is that the Crab Hatcher got a completely new look and no longer destroys itself when spawning the Flying Crabs. We’ve made the Flying Crabs themselves easier to deal with, but you will now have to destroy the Hatcher to stop it from spawning new waves of Flying Crabs.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Spitters also received a visual change, with several awesome distinct variants! There is a total of three that have adapted quite differently to their environments, as well as a minor variant of the new Forest Spitters to better camouflage in the red forests of Massage-2(AB)b.
 </p>
 <h3>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="AI_System_Overhaul">
   AI System Overhaul
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  We’ve been working on a new AI system that will allow us to introduce more variety to creature behaviour in the future. For this update we tried to largely recreate the feeling of the existing wildlife with some tweaks here and there using this new system. We are aiming for more improvements in the future to expand upon these changes.
 </p>

  <span class="mw-headline" id="Map_&amp;_Radar_Tower">

  </span>

 <p>
  The Map feature now no longer unlocks in the MAM, but during Tier 1 instead. On top of that it has received some significant upgrades with Markers that replace the Beacons, Stamps that can be used to highlight points of interest both on the Map and in world, and an updated interaction menu. It now also takes up almost the entire screen to give a better overview.
 </p>
 <p>
  Radar Towers are still unlocked in the MAM, but they come with additional functionality. If powered they now immediately reveal a set radius on the map around them, highlight all Resource Nodes in said radius, and give information on exploration rewards and wildlife that can be found there. All this makes them much more useful than they have been before!
 </p>
 <h3>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="To-do_List_updates">
   To-do List updates
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  This planning feature has received a major boost. The To-do List can now be accessed from any menu by clicking on the right side of the screen. It also received some visual polish, is height adjustable, and can be customised with written notes, which makes it a much more versatile tool than before. You can take personal notes only visible to yourself, as well as global notes that can be seen and edited by anyone in a multiplayer session. It’s even possible to do some light formatting! We’re very excited to see how you use this to your advantage.
 </p>
 <h3>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="Codex_recipe_improvements">

 <p>
  The recipe section of the codex has significantly more information available than before. All recipes can now be expanded to show the per-minute stats of all ingredients and products. You can also simulate overclocking in there now and see how that affects the recipes requirements and output.

  Since the original early access release, we’ve been collecting gameplay data on play sessions, but we saw the need to upgrade our systems and data set to better prepare for the final release of Satisfactory (whenever that is coming). With this Update we are releasing those changes for the first time, and we will probably adjust the data we collect in the future as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  All data we collect is strictly there to help us answer questions about how you all play, so we can improve the game and make better informed decisions. We don’t collect any personal data and nothing that is sent can be traced back to you.
 </p>
 <h3>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="Sublevel_Saving">
   Sublevel Saving
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  We’ve made a change to the save system that you hopefully won’t notice, but that is quite significant on our end. Basically, this allows us to migrate world elements that need to be saved onto streaming tiles, where previously they were always loaded. While this won’t significantly affect load or save times, it paves the way for us to add more interactable/saved game features to the world in the future without performance drawbacks.
