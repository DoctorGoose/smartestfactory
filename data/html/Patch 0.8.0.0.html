  Hi Pioneers!
Since you’re reading this, Update 8 is now out on Experimental for you all to try and let us know what you think. We’ve put in great effort to stabilise the game before it gets out to you, but with a major engine upgrade there are always extra chances for issues to occur. So, while you hopefully enjoy all the new goodies, keep an eye out for bugs and problems and most importantly: BACK UP YOUR SAVES! Better to be safe than sorry with this one. Now let’s move on to content.
 </p>
 <p>
  Oh boy, did we say this was a smaller update again? Well, it seems we’ve overshot the target a little bit and are now looking at a big package of additions, changes, and quality of life improvements coming out with Update 8!
 </p>
 <p>
  There are two new buildings joining the line-up, the Power Tower, and Priority Power Switch. The Titan Forest has gotten a new look, we’ve done updates to atmosphere and lighting, and worked on polishing many other biomes in terms of gameplay and/or visuals. Advanced Game Settings are coming to the game, allowing you to experiment and enjoy Satisfactory with less restrictions than before – if you wish. Blueprints have gotten some major improvements in how you can build with them, and we’ve added several other improvements that we’ll describe in more detail below. We also reworked a number of our systems in conjunction with the engine upgrade to make things run more smoothly for you.
 </p>
 <p>
  Find things you love? Things you hate? Tell us about any bugs, issues, and feedback you have on our Questions Site:
  <a class="external free" href="https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/" rel="nofollow">
   https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ve hit some roadblocks on the way to this release, but we’re very excited to have you finally play it. Hope you all have a great time, be safe, and best wishes from the team! ❤️
 </p>
 <h3>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="Upgrading_to_Unreal_Engine_5">
   Upgrading to Unreal Engine 5
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  The bulk of our work on Update 8 has been the engine upgrade. With this come many reworks and updates of systems that should improve aspects of the game, but it all being new also means that new issues can be hiding in lots of places as well. We’ve put a lot of effort into stabilising the game and performance before Experimental release, but there has been lots of ground to cover and this combined with the fact that you all are playing on a vast array of differing hardware means there might very well be things that we’ve missed. So again, come our usual reminders: please back up your saves beforehand and let us know about any differences that you encounter, good or bad, while playing Update 8.
 </p>
 <p>
  Below are the most relevant details on what this engine upgrade means for Satisfactory, but if you’ve got some time on your hands Jace talked about the upgrade in depth in one of our earliest Update 8 related videos:

 <h4>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="World_partitioning">
   World partitioning
  </span>
 </h4>
 <p>
  This is the new system in Unreal Engine 5 for streaming parts of the world in and out, and we’ve switched to it entirely. The base line for you is that with world partitioning the level streaming should be much more flexible compared to the tile-based system we used before, reducing hitches that you will have encountered at specific parts of the world where these tiles used to intersect.
 </p>
 <h4>
  <span id="Vehicle_physics_.26_sound_overhaul">
  </span>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="Vehicle_physics_&amp;_sound_overhaul">
   Vehicle physics &amp; sound overhaul
  </span>
 </h4>
 <p>
  With UE5 comes an all-new physics simulation called Chaos, and we’ve reworked our vehicles to use this instead of our previous implementation. There should be little to no changes when it comes to vehicle automation, but the manual driving of vehicles has been redone and we made improvements in feel and usage of the different vehicles. From our own tests we feel it is an upgrade overall, but we are curious to hear what you think after playing with them!
 </p>
 <p>
  With this we also reworked all vehicle sounds, eliminating many issues we couldn’t easily resolve in our old implementation, overall improving quality and consistency.
 </p>
 <h4>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="Enhanced_Input_System">
   Enhanced Input System
  </span>
 </h4>
 <p>
  Another new system that we switched to with Unreal Engine 5 is the Enhanced Input system. With this we implemented contextual key bindings in the options, allowing for much more granularity and control over your control scheme across different contexts like the build mode, driving vehicles, using equipment, etc.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using the Enhanced Input system has also made it easier for us to fix bugs related to inputs. While the migration to the new system created some short-term issues, we have done an extensive pass to ensure all inputs work as intended. But there is always the possibility that you run into an issue that we have missed, in which case you can let us know on our questions site.
 </p>

  <span class="mw-headline" id="Anti-aliasing_(TSR_&amp;_FXAA)">
   Anti-aliasing (TSR &amp; FXAA)
  </span>
 </h4>
 <p>
  For scalability options we added a lightweight anti-aliasing method known as FXAA (Fast approximate anti-aliasing) which would allow for better performance on lower end machines or for people that don’t like the effect that the previous default anti-aliasing technique had.
 </p>
 <p>
  Next to that we setup our content to work with TSR (Temporal Super Resolution) which is Epic’s implementation of upscaling technology combined with anti-aliasing. For user experience we added several presets: Performance, Balanced, Quality &amp; Insanity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Note, this doesn’t mean we won't support other Upscaling technologies in the future.
 </p>
 <h4>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="Nanite">
   Nanite
  </span>
 </h4>
 <p>
  With Unreal Engine 5 comes Nanite, a new way of rendering complex meshes allowing for high visual quality. Due to complications we only decided to convert a part of our content to Nanite. Rocks, Cliffs and Conveyor items will be using Nanite for the time being.
 </p>
 <h4>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="Lumen">
   Lumen
  </span>
 </h4>
 <p>
  Lumen is a Global Illumination system that improves lighting and reflections. This new rendering feature will make the world and factory more grounded which can result in more intense &amp; realistic scenes.
 </p>
 <p>
  We decided to have Lumen disabled by default even on the ultra-preset due to its high demand on the hardware. There are several scalability options to make Lumen perform well on most hardware.
 </p>
 <p>
  When using Lumen, we recommend running with TSR enabled on the “Performance” preset and Lumen on Medium or High due to the minimum quality difference. Next to that if you want the high-quality bounce light but not the reflections you can disable the Lumen Reflections in the video settings.

   Blueprint improvements

 <p>
  The main feature of our last update is getting some additional love in this one as well. These were a number of improvements you’ve requested and that we still wanted to make, which should significantly improve using Blueprints in Satisfactory. Since a lot changed here, we are closing the old posts on our Questions Site and are curious for you all to submit some fresh feedback after playing with all these changes. Jace talks a little about this, and mostly about the new features coming to Blueprints in this video:

  <span class="mw-headline" id="Dismantling">
   Dismantling
  </span>
 </h4>
 <p>
  Before Update 8 Blueprints were very tedious to dismantle after being placed. Now we’ve added a Blueprint dismantle mode that you can toggle with ‘R’ by default while in the regular dismantle mode. With this you can dismantle an entire Blueprint at once, significantly reducing the effort to get rid of Blueprints that are misplaced or no longer useful!
 </p>
 <h4>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="Building">
   Building
  </span>
 </h4>
 <p>
  To improve building with Blueprints we’ve added several useful features. Blueprints now have a directional indicator in their hologram making it easier to place them in the correct rotation. We also implemented Quick Switch for Blueprints, a feature we’ve already had for regular buildables, allowing you to quickly toggle through Blueprints in the same sub-category by pressing or holding ‘E’, without leaving the build mode.
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ve also added a Nudge Mode for all buildables! Using it will lock the current hologram in place, so you can move around freely to check its placement from different directions. From there you are then able to nudge the hologram around to adjust the placement, if necessary, before building it. While this feature is available for all buildables, it is particularly useful for Blueprints and other large buildings.

  <span class="mw-headline" id="Changes_to_the_world">
   Changes to the world
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  We didn’t make any changes to Resource Nodes this time around and any terrain changes we’ve done are minor, so your factories should be safe. In Update 8 we instead polished a number of areas in terms of visuals, atmosphere, and gameplay elements. Lots of work has gone into all of this, so to get an overview on what’s changed you can read the next parts below and/or look at this video covering it in a little more detail:
  <a class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/6X4jqMUtCwI" rel="nofollow">

  </a>
 </p>
 <h4>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="Visuals">
   Visuals
  </span>
 </h4>
 <p>
  Titan Forest and Red Jungle have received the most significant overhaul for their foliage, visual and sound effects, as well as lighting.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many areas have received more polish, those being the Abyss Cliffs, Rocky Desert, Eastern Dune Forest, Spire Coast, and some of the caves as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  We also updated and improved the vista around the world, which has a huge impact on the look and feel of the areas at the edge on the map. With this one we are not fully done yet, but it is certainly an upgrade, and are excited for you to see the direction it is taking.
 </p>
 <h4>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="Gameplay">
   Gameplay
  </span>
 </h4>
 <p>
  In terms of gameplay in the world, we are adding two new variants to the Hogs: The Cliff Hog and Nuclear Hog! They are the most menacing members of their family, defending their territory with devastating charges, and in case of the Nuclear Hog, also radiation.
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ve also polished and updated placements of creatures, hazards, and collectables in many areas of the world, Such as Titan Forest, Red Jungle, Spire Coast, Grass Fields, Crater Lakes, Western Beaches, Abyss Cliffs, Coin Tree Forest, Dune Desert, Northern Forest and most of their sub areas.
 </p>
 <p>
  We also did a preliminary pass of Bamboo Fields and Rocky Desert as well to prepare them for Experimental Release, though there may still be changes on them in the future.
 </p>
 <h4>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="Atmosphere">
   Atmosphere
  </span>
 </h4>
 <p>
  It was time for us to take a look at lighting and sound in the world, both with the upgrade to Unreal Engine 5 and just in general to polish things up and get rid of lingering issues. In terms of lighting, we’ve done full passes over all starting areas; Grass Fields, Rocky Desert, Northern Forest and Dune Desert, the Titan Forest, Red Jungle and Spire Coast to elevate their look and feel further and fix existing issues.
 </p>
 <p>
  When it comes to sound improvements and clean-up in the world, we’ve passed all the same areas and several more. You can find all the details in the patch notes below!
 </p>
 <h3>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="Advanced_Game_Settings">
   Advanced Game Settings
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  We are adding a number of settings that will allow you to customise your experience quite heavily when it comes to removing restrictions inherent to Satisfactory. These Advanced Game Settings can alter the experience drastically, so you can either enable them when creating a new game or when converting your existing save to using these settings when loading a save from the main menu.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is a full list of all new settings in the detailed patch notes below, but they include things such as Flight Mode making traversal and building freely a non-issue, No Build Cost which means buildables no longer need the required items to be built, Set Starting Tier allowing you to start a new game with everything up to that point unlocked and some resources to get started quickly, and No Stinger Mode fully removing the spidery Stinger enemy from the game.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many of these settings change restrictions that are part of what makes Satisfactory what it is, but we also know that people find their fun in games in different ways, and we wanted to give you the option to experiment with that and find out how you enjoy Satisfactory the most.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here is our video covering all of this in detail:
  <a class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/T2lOiHtygVM" rel="nofollow">

  </span>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="Priority_Power_Switch_&amp;_Power_Tower">
   Priority Power Switch &amp; Power Tower
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Both of these features can make a significant change in how you set up your power grid. We’ve got a summary for what they can do below, or you can watch Jace talk about them in this video:
  <a class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/v4mbNy3gt7c" rel="nofollow">
   https://youtu.be/v4mbNy3gt7c
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Priority Power Switch allows you to organise sections of your power grid into different priorities. So, if your power would fail, the Priority Power Switches turn off in order of their set priority, shutting of the parts of your factory gated behind them until there is enough power available for the remainder of your grid to keep running.
 </p>
 <p>
  While they are great to prevent full power outages, they can also be switched off and on remotely from any other Priority Power Switch, allowing you to remotely control which parts of your factory are running.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Power Tower is a large building allowing you to connect power lines over longer distances. It comes in two versions, one with a ladder and platform that make them and excellent combination with the Zipline, and one version without for a cleaner look.
 </p>

  <span class="mw-headline" id="Quality_of_life_and_other_improvements">
   Quality of life and other improvements
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  It wouldn’t be our usual updates if there weren’t several miscellaneous improvements to features and quality of life for Satisfactory included in the Update, so let’s take a quick look at these as well!
 </p>
 <h4>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="Destructible_Gas_Pillars">
   Destructible Gas Pillars
  </span>
 </h4>
 <p>
  With Update 8 you’ll be able to blow up Gas Pillars using the Nobelisk! We’ve been wanting to add this for a while, and it is finally in the game. After unlocking Nobelisks you won’t have to worry anymore about odd Gas Pillars disrupting how you can build your factories.
 </p>
 <h4>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="Jetpack_fuels">
   Jetpack fuels
  </span>
 </h4>
 <p>
  The Jetpack can now use a selection of fuels with different burn rates and acceleration. Thanks to this the Jetpack can be used before automating fuel with Solid Biofuel, and in the late game you can even use Turbofuel which has unparalleled acceleration.
 </p>
 <h4>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="Parachute">
   Parachute
  </span>
 </h4>
 <p>
  This feature has received some changes to make it a viable tool in the early to mid-game. For one, the Parachute no longer gets consumed when used, so you can now make one and use it for as long as you want.
 </p>
 <p>
  It now has a standard and sprint speed, which match the Bladerunner speeds, and we balanced it to be an excellent tool for making longer jumps while exploring and traversing your factory. Of course, it also retains its signature function of preventing fall damage in any dicey situations you might find yourself in.
 </p>
 <h4>
  <span class="mw-headline" id="Dismantle_Filter">
   Dismantle Filter
  </span>
 </h4>
 <p>
  We’ve added a filter to the Dismantle Mode where you can hover over a specific type of building, such as a Constructor, and select it to your dismantle filter. While remaining in Dismantle Mode you will only highlight the selected type of building for dismantling, making it much easier to dismantle specific parts of your factory while avoiding removing the other parts you want to keep by accident, such as Foundations.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can switch the filter freely while dismantling, and it works with both the new Blueprint Dismantle Mode and Mass Dismantle!
 </p>
 <p>
